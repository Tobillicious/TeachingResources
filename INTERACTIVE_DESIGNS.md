## **Activity 3: Conclusion Builder Tool**

*   **Associated Handout:** `writers-toolkit-conclusion-handout.html`
*   **Learning Goal:** To construct a well-structured concluding paragraph by breaking it down into its key components.

### **Concept**

A guided, step-by-step tool that scaffolds the writing of a concluding paragraph. This is a utility, not a game.

### **Interface**

*   **Title:** "Conclusion Builder"
*   **Instructions:** "Follow the steps below to build a powerful concluding paragraph. Write one or two sentences for each prompt."
*   The interface will be a series of four text-input boxes, each with a clear prompt.
*   Below the input boxes, a "Live Preview" area will show the full paragraph being constructed in real-time as the user types.

### **Process & Prompts**

**Step 1: Restate Your Main Point**
*   **Prompt:** "Start by restating your main argument in a new and powerful way. Don't just repeat your introduction."
*   **Input Box:** A text area for the student to write their sentence.

**Step 2: Summarize Your Key Evidence**
*   **Prompt:** "Briefly summarize the most important points or pieces of evidence you discussed."
*   **Input Box:** A text area for the student to write their summary.

**Step 3: Explain the 'So What?'**
*   **Prompt:** "Explain why this matters. What is the bigger lesson or implication? Answer the question, 'So what?'"
*   **Input Box:** A text area for the student to write their explanation.

**Step 4: End with a Call to Action or Final Thought**
*   **Prompt:** "End with a memorable final sentence. What do you want your reader to think, feel, or do now?"
*   **Input Box:** A text area for the student to write their final sentence.

### **Functionality**

1.  The user enters text into the first input box. The text immediately appears in the "Live Preview" area below.
2.  As the user moves to the next input box, the new text is appended to the preview, forming a complete paragraph.
3.  A "Copy to Clipboard" button is located below the "Live Preview" area.
4.  When the user clicks this button, the entire generated paragraph is copied, and a confirmation message ("Copied!") appears briefly.
5.  A "Start Over" button allows the user to clear all fields and begin again.
