                <p class="text-justify">
                    Throughout this unit, we have explored how language and visual texts can be used to persuade an audience. Now, it's your turn to put these skills into action. Your task is to create a complete persuasive campaign for a social or environmental issue that you are passionate about. You will work in a small group to research your chosen issue, develop a clear message, and create a set of persuasive texts designed to convince your audience to think, feel, or act differently.

                        <p class="text-sm">You will write and perform a 2-3 minute persuasive speech that forms the core of your campaign's argument. This speech must be well-structured (using PEEL) and employ rhetorical devices (Ethos, Pathos, Logos) to be effective.</p>

                        <p class="text-sm">You will create a visual component to support your campaign. This could be a poster, a political cartoon, or a short (30-60 second) video advertisement. It must use visual language techniques to reinforce your message.</p>
