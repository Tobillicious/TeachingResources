                    <p><strong>For Support:</strong> Provide a more structured design brief with specific constraints and requirements. Work with a small group to help them develop their ideas.</p>
                    <p><strong>For Extension:</strong> Challenge students to create a business plan for their sustainable technology. Who would be the target audience? How would it be funded?</p>
