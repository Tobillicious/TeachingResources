# Project Vision: Te Kete Ako

## Guiding Kaupapa

"Te Kete Ako" will be a digital kete (basket) of knowledge, designed to empower kaiako (teachers) and ākonga (students) at Mangakōtukutuku College. Our vision is to create a living repository of teaching and learning resources that is deeply rooted in the principles of the New Zealand Curriculum (NZC).

## Key Principles

Our work on this project will be guided by the following principles of the NZC:

*   **High Expectations:** The platform will support all students to achieve their full potential by providing access to high-quality, engaging, and challenging learning resources.
*   **Treaty of Waitangi:** We will ensure that the platform reflects the unique bicultural heritage of Aotearoa New Zealand. This includes prioritizing the integration of mātauranga Māori (Māori knowledge) and te reo Māori.
*   **Cultural Diversity:** The platform will be inclusive and celebrate the diverse cultures and identities of our school community.
*   **Inclusion:** All resources will be designed to be accessible to students with a wide range of learning needs.
*   **Learning to Learn:** The platform will encourage students to become active, reflective, and lifelong learners.
*   **Community Engagement:** We will seek opportunities to connect with our local community and iwi to enrich the resources available on the platform.
*   **Coherence:** The platform will be designed to support coherent and meaningful learning pathways for students.
*   **Future Focus:** The platform will equip students with the knowledge, skills, and values they need to thrive in a rapidly changing world.

## Desired Outcomes

By creating "Te Kete Ako," we aim to:

*   **Enhance Teaching and Learning:** Provide teachers with a rich and diverse collection of resources to support their planning and practice.
*   **Improve Student Engagement:** Offer students engaging and culturally relevant learning materials that connect to their lives and experiences.
*   **Strengthen our School Community:** Create a collaborative space where teachers can share their expertise and resources.
*   **Promote Biculturalism:** Increase the visibility and use of mātauranga Māori and te reo Māori across the curriculum.
*   **Support Personalised Learning:** Enable students to access resources that are tailored to their individual learning needs and interests.
