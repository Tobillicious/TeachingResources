## Core Content Directive: Aotearoa New Zealand First

**A. NZ-Centric Context:** All civics, social studies, and history content must be framed within the specific context of Aotearoa New Zealand's government, history, and societal structures. While comparative international examples are valuable, the core teaching must reflect our unique parliamentary system, the foundational role of Te Tiriti o Waitangi, and local context.

**B. Authenticity:** The `@Lead_Kaiako_Humanities` is now responsible for ensuring this directive is followed by all subordinate agents.
