**User Request:** Restore the UI, integrate missing content (Y8 Systems Unit, other root HTML files), and add external links to all pages.

**Actions Taken:**

1.  **UI Restoration:**
    *   Investigated the git history and identified that the UI issues were likely caused by a recently added, incomplete dark mode feature.
    *   Removed the dark mode styles from `css/main.css` to restore the original UI.

2.  **Content Integration:**
    *   Added the "Year 8 Systems Unit" and other missing units (4, 5, and 6) to the `unit-plans.html` page.
    *   Added the `ai-art-ethics-comprehension-handout.html` to the `handouts.html` page.
    *   Added the `decolonized-assessment-framework.html`, `english-literacy-progression-framework.html`, `social-sciences-progression-framework.html`, and `teacher-guide.html` to the `other-resources.html` page.

3.  **Footer and External Links:**
    *   Created a new `js/footer.js` file to dynamically inject a consistent footer with external links into each page.
    *   Updated `index.html`, `activities.html`, `handouts.html`, `unit-plans.html`, and `other-resources.html` to use the new footer.

**Next Steps:**

*   Continue to monitor the UI for any further issues.
*   Continue to integrate any other missing content as it is identified.
*   Review the external links in the footer and add any other relevant resources.
