# MCP Cycle 005 Log - Project Acceleration

## Orchestrator Chain of Thought

**Goal:** Execute multiple, parallel workstreams to accelerate the project towards completion.

**Workstreams:**
1.  **Unit 2 Completion:** Build out the remaining lesson plans and the central hub page for the "Decolonized Aotearoa History" unit.
2.  **LF Enrichment Implementation:** Action the first five completed reviews in the `CONTENT_REVIEW_LOG.md`, enriching existing content.
3.  **Technical Refactor:** Begin the process of adding `data-tags` to all existing resources for the new filtering system.
4.  **Navigation Update:** Add the newly created "Unit 7: Digital Technologies & AI Ethics" to the main `unit-plans.html` navigation page.

**Plan:**
-   Execute all file modifications for these four workstreams in a single, parallel block of tool calls. This demonstrates the full concurrent capability of the 28-agent team.
-   This involves a mix of `write_file` for new lesson plans and `replace` for enriching and refactoring existing files.
-   Upon completion, the project will be significantly more complete and technically robust.
