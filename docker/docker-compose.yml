      context: .
      dockerfile: Dockerfile
    image: base-agent:latest

  # Defines the container for the Web Developer Agent.

    # This tells Docker to build the image using the specialized Dockerfile.
    build:
      context: ./agents/web_developer
      dockerfile: Dockerfile
    image: web-developer-agent:latest
