                    This unit is designed to be a comprehensive, pick-up-and-teach resource for busy homeroom teachers who may not be Social Studies specialists. It explores the core idea that people and groups live together in communities shaped by systems. Students will learn about rights, responsibilities, different forms of government, and how they can participate in their communities to create positive change.

                <p class="text-gray-700 italic">
                    People and groups live together in communities that are shaped by systems. These systems change over time and affect people’s rights and responsibilities. By learning about systems, we understand how decisions are made and how we can participate.
