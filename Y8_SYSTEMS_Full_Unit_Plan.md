## **Week 5: Design and Share Your Own System**

**Focus:** This is the summative assessment week. Students will apply everything they have learned throughout the unit to design their own fair system to solve a local problem. They will present their system to the class, demonstrating their understanding of systems, rights, responsibilities, and decision-making.

### **Lesson 5.1: Plan Your Own System**

*   **Learning Goal:** I can design a fair system to solve a local problem and protect people’s rights.
*   **Time:** 75 minutes
*   **Resources:**
    *   [Resource 5.1A: "Design a System" Template](#resource-51a) (one per group).
    *   A3 paper or digital slideshow software (e.g., Google Slides).
    *   Assessment Rubric (so students can see the success criteria).

#### **Lesson Activities**

**1. Introduction to the Summative Task (15 minutes)**

*   **Teacher says:** "Kia ora, team. This week, you get to be the architects, the designers, and the leaders. You are going to use everything we've learned about systems, rights, and fairness to complete your final project for this unit. Your task is this: **In a small group, you will design a new, fair system to solve a problem in our school or local community.**"
*   Hand out the assessment rubric and briefly go over the criteria. Emphasise that the goal is to create a *system*, not just a single solution.
*   Brainstorm a list of potential problems students could tackle (e.g., too much rubbish in the playground, not enough activities at lunchtime, bullying, unsafe road crossings, lack of recycling bins).

**2. Group Brainstorm and Planning (30 minutes)**

*   Divide students into groups of 3-4.
*   Give each group a copy of [Resource 5.1A: "Design a System" Template](#resource-51a).
*   **Teacher says:** "The first step is to choose one problem your group is passionate about solving. Once you have your problem, you will use the planning template to design your system. Think carefully about each part. A good system is well-thought-out."
*   Circulate around the groups, providing guidance and feedback. Prompt their thinking with questions like:
    *   "Who will be in charge in your system? How will they be chosen?"
    *   "What is the most important right you need to protect?"
    *   "How will you make sure everyone knows the rules?"
*   **Numeracy Option:** Challenge groups to include a simple budget. "If you had $1000 to start your system, how would you spend it to make it successful?"

**3. Begin Creating Presentation (30 minutes)**

*   **Teacher says:** "Once your plan is solid, it's time to think about how you will present it to the class. You can create a poster or a digital slideshow. Your presentation needs to clearly explain the problem and how your system solves it."
*   Groups begin working on their presentations. They should include the key elements from their planning template.

### **Lesson 5.2: Present and Reflect**

*   **Learning Goal:** I can explain how systems affect people and how we can take part in making them fairer.
*   **Time:** 75 minutes
*   **Resources:**
    *   Student presentations (posters or slideshows).
    *   Peer feedback templates or sticky notes.
    *   Student workbooks.

#### **Lesson Activities**

**1. Group Presentations (40 minutes)**

*   **Teacher says:** "Today we get to see the amazing systems you have all designed. Each group will have 3-4 minutes to present their system to the class. When you are listening, you will be acting as a 'community panel.' Your job is to listen carefully and provide helpful feedback."
*   As each group presents, the rest of the class will use a peer feedback method (e.g., "Two Stars and a Wish" on a sticky note) to provide constructive comments.
    *   **Star 1:** One thing you liked about the system.
    *   **Star 2:** One thing that was explained very clearly.
    *   **Wish:** One question you have or a suggestion for improvement.
*   This process keeps the audience engaged and provides valuable feedback for the presenting group.

**2. Peer Feedback Exchange (10 minutes)**

*   After all presentations are finished, give groups time to read the feedback they have received from their peers.

**3. Final Self-Reflection (25 minutes)**

*   **Teacher says:** "We have come to the end of our unit on systems. You have all done an incredible job thinking about how our world is organised. For your final task, I want you to complete a self-reflection in your workbooks."
*   Write the reflection prompts on the board:
    1.  **What is the most important thing you have learned about systems?**
    2.  **How has your understanding of 'rights' and 'responsibilities' changed during this unit?**
    3.  **Describe one way you could participate in a system at school or in the community to make it fairer.**
*   This final reflection serves as a summative assessment of their conceptual understanding and their ability to connect the unit's ideas to their own lives.
