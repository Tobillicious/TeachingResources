# Component Analysis

This document outlines the current state of the React components in the `te-kete-ako` and `te-kete-ako-astro` projects.

## Shared Components

The following components are shared between both projects:

*   **`Header.tsx`**: Renders the main navigation header.
    *   **`te-kete-ako` version:** Uses `<Link>` from `react-router-dom` for navigation.
    *   **`te-kete-ako-astro` version:** Uses standard `<a>` tags for navigation.
*   **`ResourceCard.tsx`**: Renders a card for a single resource.
    *   The code is nearly identical in both projects.
    *   The `te-kete-ako` version uses `<Link>` from `react-router-dom`.

## `te-kete-ako-astro` Components

The `te-kete-ako-astro` project contains the following additional components:

*   **`ResourceLibrary.tsx`**: A more advanced component that displays a filterable and searchable list of resources. It uses `useState` and `useMemo` for state management and performance optimization.
*   **`tests/`**: This directory suggests that the Astro project has a testing setup, which is missing from the `te-kete-ako` project.

## Recommendations

*   **Component Library:** To improve code sharing and reduce duplication, we should create a shared component library for both projects.
*   **Routing:** We should standardize the routing solution. Since `te-kete-ako-astro` is the more advanced project, we should consider using Astro's routing capabilities and updating the `te-kete-ako` project to match.
*   **Testing:** We should add a testing framework to the `te-kete-ako` project to ensure code quality and prevent regressions.
