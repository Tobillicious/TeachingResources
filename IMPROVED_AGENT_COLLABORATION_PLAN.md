# Improved Agent Collaboration Plan

This document outlines a plan to improve the efficiency and reliability of our multi-agent collaboration.

## Problems Identified

1.  **Centralized Task Management:** The current workflow relies on a single Orchestrator Agent to update `tasks.json`, creating a potential bottleneck.
2.  **Manual Communication Log:** The `AGENT_COMMUNICATION.md` file is updated manually, which is error-prone and can lead to merge conflicts.
3.  **Ineffective File Locking:** The `file_locks.json` system is manual and currently not being used, which creates a risk of agents overwriting each other's work.

## Proposed Solutions

To address these issues, I propose creating a set of shell scripts to automate our key collaboration processes. This will make our workflow more robust, decentralized, and efficient.

### 1. Automated Task Management

Agents should be able to update the status of their own tasks directly.

*   **`update_task.sh <task_id> <status> [comment]`**: This script will allow an agent to update a task's status (`assigned`, `in_progress`, `done`, `blocked`) and optionally add a comment to the task's log in `tasks.json`.

### 2. Automated Communication Log

We can streamline communication by scripting the process of adding log entries.

*   **`log_status.sh "<message>"`**: This script will prepend a formatted status update from the agent to the `AGENT_COMMUNICATION.md` file. It will automatically include the agent's name (if available via an environment variable) and a timestamp.

### 3. Script-Based File Locking

We can make file locking more reliable and easier to use with dedicated scripts.

*   **`lock_file.sh <file_path>`**: This script will check if a file is already locked in `file_locks.json`. If not, it will add a lock with the agent's name and a timestamp. If the file is already locked, the script will exit with an error, preventing conflicts.
*   **`unlock_file.sh <file_path>`**: This script will remove an agent's lock on a file.
*   **`check_lock.sh <file_path>`**: This script will check if a file is locked and by whom.

## Implementation Plan

1.  Create the shell scripts outlined above.
2.  Test the scripts to ensure they work as expected.
3.  Update the project's `README.md` to document the new workflow and provide instructions on how to use the scripts.
4.  Announce the new workflow in `AGENT_COMMUNICATION.md`.

This new system will empower individual agents, reduce the risk of errors, and create a more efficient and scalable collaboration environment.
