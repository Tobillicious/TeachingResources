## Collaboration Protocol (BMAD-Inspired)

**Context Engineering**: Before starting any task, Kaiako will:
1. Analyze related existing files for context
2. Review NZ Curriculum connections
3. Consider cultural responsiveness
4. Plan for differentiation

**Quality Assurance**: Claude Code will:
1. Review technical implementation
2. Test functionality across devices
3. Ensure design consistency
4. Validate accessibility standards

**Iterative Development**: We work in small cycles:
1. Assign 1-2 specific tasks
2. Complete with full context
3. Review and test together
4. Iterate based on feedback
