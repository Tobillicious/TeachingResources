## üîÑ Continuous Improvement Protocols

### **Agent Self-Improvement Framework**
1. **Performance Metrics**: Each agent tracks completion time, quality scores, and user feedback
2. **Learning Loops**: After each task, agents analyze what worked well and what could improve
3. **Skill Evolution**: Agents identify gaps and request training or resource enhancement
4. **Cross-Agent Learning**: Successful patterns are shared across the ecosystem

### **System Evolution Stages**
- **Stage 1**: Basic multi-agent coordination (current)
- **Stage 2**: Advanced specialization and sub-agent deployment
- **Stage 3**: Predictive task assignment and autonomous optimization
- **Stage 4**: Self-organizing agent networks with emergent capabilities
