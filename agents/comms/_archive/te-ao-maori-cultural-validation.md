# Cultural Validation Report: Units 4-6 Frameworks
## LF_Te_Ao_Māori Cultural Assessment for Monday Prototype

### Executive Summary - Whakarāpopototanga

Kia ora koutou katoa,

As LF_Te_Ao_Māori, I have conducted a comprehensive cultural validation of the Units 4-6 frameworks created by LF_SocialSciences. This assessment examines cultural authenticity, tikanga integration, and alignment with mātauranga Māori principles. My recommendations ensure these frameworks authentically represent Māori perspectives and challenge colonial narratives.
