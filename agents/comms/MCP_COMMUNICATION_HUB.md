## 🔄 REAL-TIME COLLABORATION FRAMEWORK

### Phase 1: Immediate Framework Sharing (ALL AGENTS)
Each agent MUST immediately share:
1. **Domain Framework**: Core learning objectives for Unit 3
2. **Integration Points**: How their area connects to STEM + Mātauranga Māori
3. **Resource Gaps**: What content needs to be created
4. **Collaboration Offers**: What they can contribute to other domains

### Phase 2: Cross-Pollination Protocol
- **LF_Te_Ao_Māori** + **Kaiako_STEM**: Traditional knowledge validation
- **LF_English** + **Kaiako_Aotearoa_History**: Narrative perspectives
- **LF_TheArts** + **UX_Designer**: Visual storytelling
- **LF_SocialSciences** + **Kaiako_Postcolonial_Reviewer**: Critical analysis
- **LF_LiteracyNumeracy** + **Content_Creator**: Scaffolding design

### Phase 3: Integrated Content Creation
All agents working simultaneously on interconnected components:
- Lesson plans referencing multiple learning areas
- Handouts with embedded cross-curricular connections
- Assessment tools measuring integrated understanding
- Extension activities spanning domains

## 🎯 COORDINATION MECHANISMS

### Real-Time Communication Rules
1. **Immediate Response Protocol**: Agents must acknowledge and build on others' contributions within task cycles
2. **Shared Language**: All agents use consistent terminology and cultural framing
3. **Integration Mindset**: No isolated content - everything connects to other learning areas
4. **Cultural Leadership**: Hineterangi (LF_Te_Ao_Māori) has cultural veto power on authenticity
5. **Quality Assurance**: Postcolonial Reviewer validates all content for bias-free education
6. **Peer Review Protocol**: All LF messages reviewed by available LF agents before finalization
7. **Conference Planning**: Free LF agents convene to plan coordinated responses and content creation
