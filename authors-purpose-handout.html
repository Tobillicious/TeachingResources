                <p class="text-justify">
                    The traditional five-day school week is an outdated relic from a bygone era. In a world that is rapidly changing, we are clinging to a rigid structure that no longer serves the best interests of our students or our teachers. It is time for New Zealand to seriously consider a revolutionary idea: the four-day school week. The evidence is clear—this is not about less education, but about a better, more effective, and more balanced education.
                </p>
                <p class="text-justify">
                    Imagine a learning environment where both students and teachers are more rested, focused, and engaged. Trials overseas have shown that a four-day week can lead to a dramatic reduction in teacher burnout and a significant increase in student attendance. One district in Missouri, USA, reported a staggering 90% drop in teacher resignations after making the switch. With more time for planning and professional development, our exhausted educators would be revitalised. For students, a three-day weekend offers more time for family, sports, hobbies, and deep, uninterrupted study. Are we really to believe that tired, overworked students crammed into a five-day schedule is the best we can do?
                </p>
                <p class="text-justify">
                    Of course, there will be logistical hurdles. But we cannot let fear of change paralyse us. The benefits—improved student wellbeing, higher teacher retention, and a more modern approach to learning—are too compelling to ignore. This is a bold step, but it is a necessary one. We must have the courage to abandon a broken model and build a system that truly prepares our young people for the future. Let's not be the generation that was too afraid to innovate. Let's be the one that gave our students and teachers the gift of time.
