                    <p class="text-gray-700">After World War II, a massive wave of Māori migration occurred as people moved from their rural homes to cities like Auckland and Wellington in search of work and opportunities. This was one of the most significant social changes in 20th-century Aotearoa. While it offered economic promise, it also presented huge challenges to maintaining cultural identity away from the marae and traditional lands.</p>

                        <p class="mt-2 text-gray-700">Away from their tūrangawaewae (place to stand), many urban Māori felt a sense of disconnection from their language, culture, and community structures.</p>

                        <p class="mt-2 text-gray-700">In response, Māori communities in the cities began to build urban marae. These became vital cultural centres for people from many different iwi. This also fostered a "pan-tribal" identity, where a shared sense of being Māori became just as important as specific iwi affiliations.</p>
