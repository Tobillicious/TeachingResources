                <p class="text-justify">
                    Genetic modification (GM), also known as genetic engineering (GE), is the process of altering the genetic makeup of an organism. In New Zealand, this technology is at the centre of a fierce debate, particularly concerning its use in primary industries like agriculture and conservation. Proponents, including many scientists and agricultural companies, argue that GM could unlock significant benefits. For example, researchers at AgResearch are developing genetically modified ryegrass that could reduce methane emissions from livestock by up to 23% and grow faster, potentially boosting farm productivity and helping New Zealand meet its climate change targets.

                <p class="text-justify">
                    On the conservation front, GM is being explored as a tool for pest control. The "Predator Free 2050" initiative is investigating technologies like gene drives, which could spread a specific trait—such as infertility—through a pest population, causing it to collapse. This could offer a powerful alternative to traditional methods like traps and toxins for eradicating pests such as stoats, rats, and possums that devastate native wildlife. The potential to protect vulnerable species like the kiwi and kākāpō is a compelling argument for its use.

                <p class="text-justify">
                    However, there is strong opposition to the use of GM technology in Aotearoa. Opponents raise concerns about the unknown long-term effects on ecosystems and human health. There are fears that genetically modified organisms could escape into the wild and interbreed with native species, with unpredictable consequences. From a Māori perspective, there are significant cultural and spiritual concerns regarding the modification of whakapapa (genealogy) of living things. Furthermore, New Zealand's "clean, green" brand is a vital part of its export identity, and many worry that embracing GM could damage this reputation and alienate international consumers. Currently, the use of GM is tightly restricted to research within secure labs, but the debate over releasing GM organisms into the environment continues to intensify.
