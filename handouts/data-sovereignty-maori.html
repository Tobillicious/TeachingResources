                    <p class="text-gray-700">Māori data sovereignty is the inherent right of Māori to govern the collection, ownership, and application of their own data. It asserts that data about Māori people, their lands, and their culture is a taonga (treasure) and must be protected and controlled by Māori, for Māori.</p>

                <div class="bg-white p-4 rounded-lg shadow">
                    <p class="text-gray-700">Large Language Models are trained on data. If Māori data (e.g., Te Reo Māori, historical records, cultural stories) is used to train an AI without permission or context, the benefits of that AI may not flow back to the Māori community. There is a risk that corporations could profit from Māori knowledge while the community itself loses control over how its cultural treasures are used. Data sovereignty is about ensuring that Māori decide how their data is used and that they share in the benefits.</p>
