                    <p class="text-gray-700 text-justify">
                        Long before the invention of GPS or compasses, Polynesian navigators sailed vast distances across the Pacific Ocean. Their primary tool was an incredibly deep understanding of the stars, sun, moon, and ocean currents. This was not luck; it was a precise science passed down through generations. In Aotearoa, this knowledge, known as **kōrero whetū** or **tātai arorangi**, was essential for navigation, timing planting and harvesting, and for cultural identity.

                            The pre-dawn rising of the Matariki star cluster in mid-winter marks the beginning of the Māori New Year. Its brightness and the clarity of each star were used to predict the success of the coming season. A clear, bright Matariki signalled a warm and productive year ahead.

                            When Tautoru, the three bright stars of Orion's Belt, is seen rising in the east, it signals the time when the tuna (eels) begin their migration. This was a crucial time for harvesting this important food source.

                            This is perhaps the most famous navigating constellation in the Southern Hemisphere. By identifying Te Pae Māhutonga, navigators could reliably find the direction of south, allowing them to orient their waka (canoe) on the open ocean.

                            Rehua is one of the brightest stars in the sky. Its appearance high in the summer sky was associated with the hottest months and the time when certain fruits and berries were ripe for picking.

                        Māori navigators did not use a physical compass. Instead, they used a mental model called a **star compass**. They memorised the rising and setting points of over 200 stars on the horizon. By knowing the sequence of stars that would rise and set throughout the night, they could hold a steady course. This was combined with knowledge of ocean swells, wind patterns, and the flight of birds to create a sophisticated and reliable navigation system.
