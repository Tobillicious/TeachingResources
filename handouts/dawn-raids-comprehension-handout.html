                <p class="text-justify">
                    In the mid-1970s, New Zealand faced an economic downturn. In this climate of uncertainty, some politicians and media began to blame Pasifika peoples for economic problems and unemployment, despite the fact that many had been encouraged to migrate to New Zealand in the 1950s and 60s to fill labour shortages. This created a hostile environment where people of Pacific Island descent were unfairly targeted. The government of the time began to crack down on "overstayers"â€”people who had remained in the country after their visas had expired.
                </p>
                <p class="text-justify">
                    This crackdown took the form of aggressive and discriminatory immigration raids, which came to be known as the "Dawn Raids." Police and immigration officials would conduct raids on the homes of suspected overstayers, often in the early hours of the morning. While people of many nationalities were overstaying their visas, statistics show that Pasifika peoples were disproportionately targeted. Between 1974 and 1976, while Pacific Islanders made up only about one-third of overstayers, they accounted for over 85% of all prosecutions. People were stopped in the street, at work, or at church and asked to prove their right to be in the country. These actions created a climate of fear and trauma for the entire Pasifika community.

                <p class="text-justify">
                    The Dawn Raids are now widely condemned as a racist and unjust chapter in New Zealand's history. They inflicted lasting trauma on families and communities, and damaged the relationship between the government and Pasifika peoples. In 2021, the New Zealand government formally apologised for the raids. Prime Minister Jacinda Ardern acknowledged the actions were "discriminatory and have had a lasting and negative impact." The apology was a significant step towards healing and reconciliation, recognising the deep hurt caused and affirming the contribution of Pasifika communities to the fabric of Aotearoa.
