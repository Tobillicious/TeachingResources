                <p class="text-justify">
                    In the mid-1970s, New Zealand faced an economic downturn. In this climate of uncertainty, some politicians and media began to blame Pasifika peoples for economic problems, despite many having been encouraged to migrate to New Zealand in the 1950s and 60s to fill labour shortages. This created a hostile environment where people of Pacific Island descent were unfairly targeted. The government of the time began to crack down on "overstayers"—people who had remained in the country after their visas had expired.
                </p>
                <p class="text-justify">
                    This crackdown took the form of aggressive and discriminatory immigration raids, which came to be known as the "Dawn Raids." Police and immigration officials would conduct raids on the homes of suspected overstayers, often in the early hours of the morning. While people of many nationalities were overstaying their visas, statistics show that Pasifika peoples were disproportionately targeted. Between 1974 and 1976, while Pacific Islanders made up only about one-third of overstayers, they accounted for over 85% of all prosecutions. People were stopped in the street and asked for proof of their right to be in the country, creating a climate of fear for the entire Pasifika community. One person recalled, <em class="font-semibold">"You were scared to walk on the street. You were scared to go to the factory. The police could just stop you and ask for your passport. We felt like criminals in our own country."</em>
                </p>
                <p class="text-justify">
                    The Dawn Raids are now widely condemned as a racist and unjust chapter in New Zealand's history. They inflicted lasting trauma (māfuiʻe) on families (aiga) and communities, and damaged the relationship between the government and Pasifika peoples. In 2021, the New Zealand government formally apologised for the raids. Prime Minister Jacinda Ardern acknowledged the actions were "discriminatory and have had a lasting and negative impact." The apology was a significant step towards healing and reconciliation, recognising the deep hurt caused and affirming the contribution of Pasifika communities to the fabric of Aotearoa.

                        <p class="font-semibold mb-2">2. (Numeracy) The text states Pasifika peoples accounted for over 85% of prosecutions for overstaying. If there were 1,000 prosecutions in total, approximately how many would have involved Pacific Islanders?</p>

                        <div class="text-sm"><p>It means that Pasifika peoples were targeted far more often than other ethnic groups, even though they were not the only group with overstayers.</p></div>
