                <p class="text-justify">
                    In the past, information was primarily distributed by a small number of trusted sources, like established newspapers and television networks. Today, the internet and social media have created a vast, decentralised information landscape where anyone can be a publisher. While this has democratised the flow of information, it has also created a significant challenge: the rise of "fake news," or more accurately, misinformation and disinformation. Misinformation is false information spread unintentionally, while disinformation is false information spread deliberately to deceive.
                </p>
                <p class="text-justify">
                    These false narratives often spread faster and wider than factual reporting. A 2018 study by MIT found that false news on Twitter was 70% more likely to be retweeted than the truth. This is because false stories are often more novel and emotionally charged, appealing to our biases and fears. Social media algorithms, which are designed to maximise engagement, can amplify this problem by creating "filter bubbles" or "echo chambers." These algorithms show us content they think we will like, reinforcing our existing beliefs and limiting our exposure to different perspectives. This can make it difficult to distinguish fact from fiction.
                </p>
                <p class="text-justify">
                    Developing strong media literacy skills is the essential defence against this modern problem. This involves more than just consuming information; it requires active questioning and critical evaluation. Key strategies include checking the source of an article, looking for evidence and corroboration from other reputable outlets, and being aware of our own emotional responses to a story. Before sharing a shocking headline, a critical thinker asks: Who created this? Why did they create it? And who benefits from me believing it? In an age of information overload, the ability to critically evaluate sources is no longer just an academic skill—it is a fundamental requirement for responsible citizenship.
