                <p class="text-justify">
                    A speech is a unique form of communication, designed to be heard rather than read. A great speaker does more than just present information; they use a combination of a well-structured argument and powerful delivery to connect with their audience on both an intellectual and an emotional level. To analyse a speech effectively, we need to consider not only *what* is being said, but *how* it is being said. This involves looking at the argument's structure, the persuasive techniques used, and the speaker's tone and body language.

                <p class="italic text-justify">
                   "Friends, colleagues, fellow citizens. I want you to picture something with me. Picture the local park on a Saturday morning. But instead of the usual sounds—the laughter, the shouting, the joyful chaos—there is only silence. The swings hang motionless. The slide is empty. This is the future we are building for our children if we continue to allow digital devices to replace outdoor play. A silent, empty future.
                   <br><br>
                   Now, I'm not an anti-technology dinosaur. I understand the value of these tools for learning and connection. But as a parent and a former teacher, I have seen the change with my own eyes. I have seen the boundless energy of a child replaced by the vacant stare of a screen. Studies from the Ministry of Health are clear: outdoor play is essential for physical development, for social skills, and for mental wellbeing. The data shows a 40% increase in childhood obesity in the last decade alone, a statistic that should alarm every single one of us.
                   <br><br>
                   We stand at a crossroads. One path leads to a generation of children who know how to swipe and scroll, but not how to climb and create. The other path, the harder path, leads to a future where technology serves us, not the other way around. It is a future where our parks are once again filled with the sound of laughter. So I ask you: which future will you choose for your children? Let's choose the one with more scraped knees and less screen time. Thank you."
