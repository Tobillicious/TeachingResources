## Unit Overview

This unit will empower students to find their voice as creative writers. Through a series of scaffolded activities, students will explore the building blocks of narrative, analyze how established authors create compelling stories, and apply these techniques to their own writing. The unit culminates in a short story portfolio.

## Learning Objectives

By the end of this unit, students will be able to:
- Identify and analyze the key elements of a story (plot, character, setting, theme).
- Develop a compelling original character.
- Structure a narrative with a clear beginning, middle, and end.
- Use descriptive language ("show, don't tell") to create vivid settings and moods.
- Edit and revise their work for clarity, impact, and correctness.
