## How to Read the Periodic Table

The Periodic Table of Elements is a table that organizes all of the known elements in the universe. Each box represents one element.

```
  +-----------------+
  | 6               |  <-- Atomic Number (Number of Protons)
  |       C         |  <-- Element Symbol
  |     Carbon      |  <-- Element Name
  |      12.01      |  <-- Atomic Mass (Protons + Neutrons)
  +-----------------+
```

## The Layout

### Periods (Rows)
The horizontal rows of the table are called **periods**. There are 7 periods. As you move from left to right across a period, the atomic number of the elements increases by one.

### Groups (Columns)
The vertical columns of the table are called **groups** or **families**. There are 18 groups. Elements in the same group have similar chemical properties because they have the same number of electrons in their outermost shell.

## Key Families

### Group 1: Alkali Metals
-   Very reactive metals.
-   Examples: Lithium (Li), Sodium (Na).

### Group 2: Alkaline Earth Metals
-   Reactive, but less so than Alkali Metals.
-   Examples: Magnesium (Mg), Calcium (Ca).

### Groups 3-12: Transition Metals
-   The large block in the middle of the table.
-   These are the metals we are most familiar with.
-   Examples: Iron (Fe), Copper (Cu), Gold (Au).

### Group 17: Halogens
-   Very reactive non-metals.
-   Often form salts with metals.
-   Examples: Chlorine (Cl), Iodine (I).

### Group 18: Noble Gases
-   Very unreactive (inert) gases.
-   They have a full outer shell of electrons, making them very stable.
-   Examples: Helium (He), Neon (Ne), Argon (Ar).
