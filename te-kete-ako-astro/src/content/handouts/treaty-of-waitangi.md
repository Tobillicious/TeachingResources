## What is the Treaty?

The **Treaty of Waitangi (Te Tiriti o Waitangi)** is an agreement signed in 1840 by representatives of the British Crown and many M캐ori chiefs (rangatira). It is considered New Zealand's founding document and plays a central role in the relationship between M캐ori and the Crown.

## Two Versions, Big Differences

Crucially, there are two versions of the Treaty: an English version and a Te Reo M캐ori version. These versions differ significantly in their meaning, leading to ongoing debate and interpretation.

### The English Version

*   **Article 1:** M캐ori chiefs gave the Queen of England "all the rights and powers of Sovereignty" (complete control over the country).
*   **Article 2:** Guaranteed M캐ori "full exclusive and undisturbed possession of their Lands and Estates, Forests, Fisheries and other properties" (ownership of their land and resources).
*   **Article 3:** Gave M캐ori the same rights and privileges as British subjects.

### The Te Reo M캐ori Version

*   **Article 1:** M캐ori chiefs gave the Queen **"k캐wanatanga"** (governance), the right to make laws for peace and order, but not full sovereignty.
*   **Article 2:** Guaranteed M캐ori **"tino rangatiratanga"** (absolute chieftainship/sovereignty) over their lands, villages, and all their treasures (**"taonga"** - including language, culture, and customs).
*   **Article 3:** Gave M캐ori the same rights as British people.

## Why the Difference Matters

The different meanings of key words led to major misunderstandings. M캐ori believed they were giving the British the right to govern, but that they would keep their own authority over their lands and people. The British believed they were gaining full sovereignty over the country. These differences have been a source of conflict and debate ever since, leading to land confiscations and other injustices.

## The Three "P's": Principles of the Treaty

Today, the relationship between the Crown and M캐ori is guided by the principles of the Treaty, often summarised as the three "P's". These principles help us interpret the Treaty in a modern context:

*   **Partnership:** M캐ori and the Crown must work together in good faith on issues of common concern. This means mutual respect and cooperation.
*   **Protection:** The Crown has a responsibility to actively protect M캐ori interests, including their language (Te Reo M캐ori), culture, resources, and institutions.
*   **Participation:** M캐ori must be able to participate in all levels of government and decision-making processes that affect them.

## Thinking Point 游뱂

How might the different understandings of the Treaty affect a decision about building a new road through land that is important to a local iwi (tribe)? Consider both the historical context and the modern principles.
