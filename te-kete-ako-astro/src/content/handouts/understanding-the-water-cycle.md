## Summary

This handout provides a clear explanation of the water cycle (hydrologic cycle), detailing its key stages: evaporation, condensation, precipitation, and collection (runoff and infiltration). It emphasizes the vital role of the water cycle in sustaining life on Earth by distributing water, regulating climate, supporting ecosystems, and shaping landscapes. The handout aims to foster an understanding of this fundamental Earth process and its importance.

**Key Concepts Covered:**
*   Definition of the water cycle (hydrologic cycle).
*   Key stages: Evaporation (including transpiration), Condensation, Precipitation, Collection (Runoff, Infiltration, Storage).
*   Importance of the water cycle for life, climate regulation, ecosystems, and landscapes.

## Overview for Kaiako

**LEARNING AREA:** Science (Planet Earth and Beyond, Living World, Nature of Science)

**YEAR LEVEL:** Year 7-9 (adaptable for Year 10-13 with deeper exploration of hydrological processes)

**CURRICULUM LINKS:** Supports Achievement Objectives related to understanding Earth's processes; exploring the interconnectedness of natural systems; understanding the importance of water as a resource; developing scientific inquiry skills (NZC Science, Level 3/4; Te Mataiaho: Te Ao Tūroa - The Natural World).

**KEY COMPETENCIES:** Thinking (analyzing natural processes, understanding cause and effect, interpreting scientific diagrams), Managing Self (fostering curiosity about natural phenomena, appreciating water as a resource), Participating and Contributing (engaging in discussions about water conservation), Using Language, Symbols, and Texts (interpreting scientific terminology, understanding diagrams).

**VALUES:** Whanaungatanga (understanding our shared reliance on water, collective responsibility for water resources), Manaakitanga (caring for waterways and water quality), Whaiora (promoting a healthy environment for all), Tūrangawaewae (connecting the water cycle to local rivers, lakes, and oceans in Aotearoa, discussing Māori perspectives on water as a life force - waiora).

**CULTURAL CONSIDERATIONS & ADAPTATIONS:** Discuss Māori concepts of water (wai) as a life force (waiora) and its spiritual significance; explore traditional Māori practices of water management and conservation (e.g., kaitiakitanga of awa/rivers and moana/oceans); use examples of local waterways in Mangakotukutuku's community to illustrate the water cycle; encourage students to consider the cultural importance of water for drinking, kai (food), and cultural practices; discuss the impact of pollution on waterways from diverse perspectives.

## What is the Water Cycle?

The **water cycle**, also known as the **hydrologic cycle**, describes the continuous movement of water on, above, and below the surface of the Earth. It is a vital process that sustains life on our planet by constantly distributing and recycling water.

### Key Stages of the Water Cycle:

1.  **Evaporation:**
    The process by which water changes from a liquid into a gas (water vapor) and rises into the atmosphere. This primarily occurs from oceans, lakes, and rivers, driven by the sun's energy.
    *   **Transpiration:** A specific type of evaporation where plants release water vapor into the atmosphere through their leaves.

2.  **Condensation:**
    As water vapor rises into the atmosphere, it cools. When it cools enough, it changes back into tiny liquid water droplets or ice crystals, forming clouds. This is why you see clouds!

3.  **Precipitation:**
    When the water droplets or ice crystals in clouds become too heavy, they fall back to Earth in various forms. This is what we experience as rain, snow, sleet, or hail.

4.  **Collection (Runoff and Infiltration):**
    Once precipitation reaches the Earth's surface, it can follow several paths:
    *   **Runoff:** Water flows over the land surface, eventually collecting in streams, rivers, lakes, and oceans. This water then evaporates again, continuing the cycle.
    *   **Infiltration/Percolation:** Water soaks into the ground, moving downwards through soil and rock layers to become **groundwater**. This groundwater can be stored in underground reservoirs called aquifers or flow slowly into bodies of water.
    *   **Storage:** Water can be stored for varying periods in oceans (the largest reservoir), lakes, rivers, glaciers, ice caps, and as groundwater before continuing through the cycle.

### The Importance of the Water Cycle:

*   **Distributes Water:** Ensures that fresh water is available across different regions of the Earth, supporting diverse ecosystems and human populations.
*   **Regulates Climate:** Plays a crucial role in regulating Earth's temperature by absorbing and releasing heat as water changes states (liquid, gas, solid).
*   **Supports Ecosystems:** Provides the water necessary for all living organisms (plants, animals, humans) and habitats to survive and thrive.
*   **Shapes Landscapes:** Erosion (wearing away) and deposition (building up) by moving water contribute to the formation of valleys, canyons, deltas, and other landforms over long periods.
