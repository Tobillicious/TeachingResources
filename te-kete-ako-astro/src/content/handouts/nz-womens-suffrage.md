## A World First

On **September 19, 1893**, New Zealand became the first self-governing country in the world in which all women had the right to vote in parliamentary elections. This was the culmination of decades of campaigning by dedicated women and men.

## Key Figures

-   **Kate Sheppard:** The most famous leader of the women's suffrage movement in New Zealand. She was a brilliant organizer and public speaker who led the Women's Christian Temperance Union (WCTU) campaign.
-   **Meri Te Tai Mangakāhia:** A prominent Māori woman of high rank who, in 1893, petitioned the Māori Parliament for women to have the right to vote and to stand for election.
-   **Sir John Hall:** A former Premier of New Zealand who was a key political ally of the suffrage movement in Parliament.

## The Campaign

The campaign for women's suffrage was a massive grassroots effort. The main strategies included:
-   **Public Meetings and Speeches:** Suffragists travelled the country, giving speeches and holding public meetings to raise awareness and support.
-   **Pamphlets and Publications:** They produced a huge amount of written material, including pamphlets, articles, and letters to the editor, to argue their case.
-   **Petitions:** The most famous tactic was the use of massive petitions. In 1893, a petition with the signatures of nearly 32,000 women (almost a quarter of the adult European female population of New Zealand) was presented to Parliament. It was unrolled across the chamber of the House to dramatic effect.

## Arguments For and Against

### Arguments For Suffrage
-   **Equality:** Women are equal to men and therefore deserve the same political rights.
-   **Moral Superiority:** Women were seen as morally superior to men, and it was argued that their vote would help to "purify" politics and lead to social reforms, such as the prohibition of alcohol.
-   **No Taxation Without Representation:** Women paid taxes, so they should have a say in how the country is run.

### Arguments Against Suffrage
-   **Separate Spheres:** The belief that women's proper place was in the home (the "private sphere"), while men belonged in the world of work and politics (the "public sphere").
-   **Emotional and Irrational:** Opponents argued that women were too emotional and irrational to be trusted with the vote.
-   **Neglect of Family:** It was claimed that if women became involved in politics, they would neglect their duties as wives and mothers.
