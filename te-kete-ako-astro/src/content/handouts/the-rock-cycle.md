## The Three Main Types of Rock

### 1. Igneous Rock
-   **How it's formed:** Formed from the cooling and solidification of magma (molten rock).
-   **Examples:** Granite, Basalt, Pumice.

### 2. Sedimentary Rock
-   **How it's formed:** Formed from the accumulation and cementation of sediment (small pieces of rock, minerals, or organic matter).
-   **Key Features:** Often contains fossils and is formed in layers.
-   **Examples:** Sandstone, Limestone, Shale.

### 3. Metamorphic Rock
-   **How it's formed:** Formed when existing igneous or sedimentary rocks are changed by intense heat and pressure.
-   **Examples:** Marble (from limestone), Slate (from shale), Quartzite (from sandstone).

## The Rock Cycle

The rock cycle is a continuous process that describes how the three main rock types are created, changed, and recycled.

*(A diagram of the rock cycle would be included here in a full resource, showing the relationships between magma, igneous rock, sediment, sedimentary rock, and metamorphic rock.)*

-   **Cooling:** Magma cools to form **igneous rock**.
-   **Weathering & Erosion:** All rock types can be broken down into **sediment**.
-   **Compaction & Cementation:** Sediment is pressed together to form **sedimentary rock**.
-   **Heat & Pressure:** All rock types can be transformed by heat and pressure into **metamorphic rock**.
-   **Melting:** Any rock that is pulled deep into the Earth can melt back into **magma**.
