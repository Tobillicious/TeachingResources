## Summary

This handout introduces students to the five stages of the Design Thinking process: Empathise, Define, Ideate, Prototype, and Test. It explains this human-centred approach to creative problem-solving, providing clear definitions and a practical design challenge. The handout encourages students to apply this iterative process to real-world problems, fostering innovation and critical thinking.

**Key Concepts Covered:**
*   The five stages of Design Thinking.
*   Human-centred problem-solving.
*   Iterative nature of design.
*   Application of Design Thinking to practical challenges.

## Overview for Kaiako

**LEARNING AREA:** Digital Technologies (primary), Technology, Social Sciences (secondary)

**YEAR LEVEL:** Year 8-13

**CURRICULUM LINKS:** Supports Achievement Objectives related to understanding how digital systems work and their impact on society; applying design processes to develop solutions; understanding the iterative nature of technological practice; developing creative and critical thinking skills (NZC Digital Technologies, Progress Outcome 3/4; Technology, Level 4/5; Te Mataiaho: Te Ao Hangarau - Digital Technologies, Te Ao Tangata - Social Sciences).

**KEY COMPETENCIES:** Thinking (creative problem-solving, critical analysis of solutions), Managing Self (perseverance, adaptability in iterative processes), Participating and Contributing (collaborative design, user feedback), Using Language, Symbols, and Texts (communicating design ideas, interpreting user needs).

**VALUES:** Whanaungatanga (collaborative problem-solving, designing for community needs), Manaakitanga (empathizing with users, designing inclusive solutions), Whaiora (fostering creativity and innovation for well-being), T≈´rangawaewae (designing solutions for local challenges, connecting design to cultural contexts and traditional MƒÅori design principles).

**CULTURAL CONSIDERATIONS & ADAPTATIONS:** Discuss how traditional MƒÅori design (e.g., carving, weaving, architecture) often incorporates human-centred principles and iterative processes; encourage students to identify problems within their own whƒÅnau, hap≈´, or iwi that could be addressed through design thinking; use examples of design solutions from diverse cultural contexts; emphasize the importance of empathy and understanding diverse user needs, particularly for students from various cultural backgrounds at Mangakotukutuku College.

## The Design Thinking Process

Design Thinking is a human-centred approach to innovation that focuses on understanding user needs, challenging assumptions, and redefining problems in an attempt to identify alternative strategies and solutions that might not be instantly apparent. It's an iterative process, meaning you often go back to earlier steps based on what you learn.

### The Five Stages:

1.  **üë• Empathise:**
    Understand the user's needs, thoughts, and feelings. This involves observing, engaging, and immersing yourself in their experiences. *Who are you designing for? What are their challenges?*

2.  **üéØ Define:**
    Clearly state the problem you are trying to solve based on your user's needs and insights gained during the Empathise stage. This stage frames the problem in a human-centred way. *What is the core problem we need to solve?*

3.  **üí° Ideate:**
    Brainstorm a wide range of creative solutions and ideas without judgment. The goal is quantity over quality at this stage. Think outside the box! *How might we solve this problem?*

4.  **üõ†Ô∏è Prototype:**
    Build a simple, low-cost version of your solution to see how it works. This could be a sketch, a model, or a basic digital mock-up. The purpose is to test ideas quickly. *What can we build to test our idea?*

5.  **üß™ Test:**
    Get feedback from users on your prototype. Observe how they interact with it, ask questions, and gather insights. This feedback informs further iterations of your design. *Does our solution work? What can we improve?*

### Design Challenge: The Perfect School Bag

Apply the Design Thinking process to design a better school bag for students at Mangakotukutuku College.

1.  **Empathise:** What are the problems with current school bags for students at our kura? (Interview a friend, observe students, or think about your own experience).

2.  **Define:** Based on your empathy, what is the main problem you want to solve with a new school bag design?

3.  **Ideate:** Brainstorm 3-5 innovative features for your new bag design. Think about materials, compartments, comfort, and cultural relevance.

4.  **Prototype:** Draw a quick sketch of your new school bag design, labeling its key features.

5.  **Test:** How would you get feedback on your design from other students or teachers at Mangakotukutuku College? What questions would you ask?
