## Summary

This handout introduces students to Aristotle's three modes of persuasion: Ethos (appeal to credibility), Pathos (appeal to emotion), and Logos (appeal to logic). It defines each rhetorical device with clear examples and explains how writers use them to build compelling arguments. The handout includes exercises for identifying these appeals and a creative challenge for applying them in persuasive writing, fostering critical analysis and effective communication.

**Key Concepts Covered:**
*   Definitions and examples of Ethos, Pathos, and Logos.
*   Understanding how rhetorical devices enhance persuasion.
*   Analyzing persuasive texts for rhetorical appeals.
*   Applying rhetorical devices in persuasive writing.

## What are Rhetorical Devices?

Beyond a well-structured PEEL paragraph, skilled writers use specific techniques to make their arguments more compelling. These are called **rhetorical devices**. Over 2,000 years ago, the Greek philosopher Aristotle identified three primary modes of persuasion that are still incredibly relevant today: **Ethos, Pathos, and Logos**. Understanding these three "artistic proofs" allows you to both analyze persuasive texts more deeply and to make your own writing far more effective.

### The Three Artistic Proofs

**ETHOS (Appeal to Authority & Credibility)**

This is about building trust with your audience. An author uses Ethos to convince the reader that they are a credible, trustworthy, and knowledgeable source. This makes the audience more likely to believe their argument.

*   **How it's done:** Citing experts, using professional language, highlighting relevant personal experience, showing fairness and respect for opposing views.
*   *Example:* "As a marine biologist with 20 years of experience studying the Hauraki Gulf, I can attest to the devastating impact of overfishing."

**PATHOS (Appeal to Emotion)**

This is about connecting with the reader's emotions. An author uses Pathos to evoke feelings like anger, sympathy, joy, or fear to make the audience feel personally connected to the issue.

*   **How it's done:** Using vivid, emotionally charged language; telling personal stories (anecdotes); using figurative language like metaphors.
*   *Example:* "Imagine the heartbreak of a family forced from their home, their belongings packed into a single suitcase, all because of a landlord's greedy rent increase."

**LOGOS (Appeal to Logic & Reason)**

This is about appealing to the audience's intellect. An author uses Logos to present a logical, well-reasoned argument based on facts and evidence.

*   **How it's done:** Presenting facts and statistics, using if/then statements, citing research, creating a clear, structured argument (like PEEL).
*   *Example:* "The data is undeniable: over the past five years, communities that invested in youth programmes saw a 40% reduction in petty crime."

### Deconstruction & Application

1.  **Deconstruction:** Read the sentences below and identify the primary rhetorical appeal being used (Ethos, Pathos, or Logos).

    *"Every year, thousands of helpless kittens are abandoned on the street. Can you really turn your back on a shivering, hungry animal in need?"

    **Appeal:** ____________________

    *"A survey of 1,500 New Zealand employees showed that 82% favoured a four-day work week, indicating a clear preference for a better work-life balance."

    **Appeal:** ____________________

2.  **Application:** Your task is to write three separate sentences to persuade your principal to build a new school library. Write one sentence for each appeal.

    **Ethos:**
    **Pathos:**
    **Logos:**
