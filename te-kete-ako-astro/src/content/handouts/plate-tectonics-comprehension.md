## Summary

This handout provides a reading comprehension text that explores the geological forces shaping Aotearoa New Zealand, focusing on plate tectonics and its direct link to earthquakes, volcanoes, and geothermal energy. Students will analyze how New Zealand's unique position on a plate boundary influences its landscape and natural resources, engaging with critical thinking questions about geological processes and sustainable resource management.

**Key Concepts Covered:**
*   New Zealand's position on tectonic plate boundaries (Pacific and Australian Plates).
*   Geological processes: subduction, plate grinding (Alpine Fault).
*   Connection between tectonic activity and earthquakes/volcanoes.
*   Harnessing geothermal energy as a renewable resource.
*   Sustainability of geothermal resources.

## Overview for Kaiako

**LEARNING AREA:** Science (Planet Earth and Beyond, Nature of Science)

**YEAR LEVEL:** Year 10-13

**CURRICULUM LINKS:** Supports Achievement Objectives related to understanding Earth's processes; exploring the interconnections between geological activity and natural resources; analyzing scientific information and societal responses; understanding the importance of sustainable resource management (NZC Science, Level 5; Te Mataiaho: Te Ao Tūroa - The Natural World, Te Ao Tangata - Social Sciences).

**KEY COMPETENCIES:** Thinking (analyzing geological processes, interpreting scientific data, critical evaluation), Managing Self (understanding natural hazards, preparing for emergencies), Participating and Contributing (engaging in discussions about resource management, understanding community resilience), Using Language, Symbols, and Texts (interpreting geological diagrams, understanding scientific terminology).

**VALUES:** Whanaungatanga (understanding shared vulnerability to natural hazards, collective responsibility for resource management), Manaakitanga (caring for the environment, promoting sustainable practices), Whaiora (fostering scientific curiosity and understanding of natural phenomena), Tūrangawaewae (connecting geological processes to the unique landscapes and cultural significance of specific sites in Aotearoa, discussing Māori perspectives on Papatūānuku).

**CULTURAL CONSIDERATIONS & ADAPTATIONS:** Discuss Māori narratives and traditional knowledge (mātauranga Māori) related to geological activity (e.g., Rūaumoko, the god of earthquakes and volcanoes); explore the cultural significance of geothermal areas (e.g., Rotorua, Taupō) for Māori; use examples of how Māori communities have adapted to and lived with geological hazards; encourage students to consider the concept of kaitiakitanga (guardianship) in relation to geothermal resources and land management.

## Reading Comprehension: Aotearoa's Shaky Ground

### Living on the Edge

New Zealand's dramatic landscape of mountains, volcanoes, and hot springs is the direct result of its precarious position on the boundary of two of the world's major **tectonic plates**. The country sits astride the junction of the Pacific Plate and the Australian Plate. To the east of the North Island, the Pacific Plate is being forced under the Australian Plate in a process called **subduction**. In the South Island, the plates grind past each other along the Alpine Fault. This constant geological activity is responsible for the approximately 20,000 earthquakes New Zealand experiences each year, though only about 250 of these are strong enough to be felt.

This same tectonic activity, however, provides New Zealand with a significant natural advantage: abundant **geothermal energy**. In areas like the Taupō Volcanic Zone, magma (molten rock) sits relatively close to the Earth's surface, heating underground water reservoirs to extreme temperatures. Geothermal power plants harness this energy by drilling wells deep into these reservoirs. The hot, high-pressure steam that rushes to the surface is used to spin turbines, which generate electricity. The Wairākei Geothermal Power Station, opened in 1958, was the first of its kind in the world to use 'wet' steam technology.

Geothermal energy is a key part of New Zealand's renewable energy profile. It is a more reliable power source than wind or solar, as it is not dependent on weather conditions and can operate 24/7. In 2022, geothermal energy accounted for approximately 18% of New Zealand's total electricity generation. While the initial construction of a geothermal plant is expensive, they have low running costs and a small environmental footprint compared to fossil fuels. The challenge for the future is to manage these geothermal resources sustainably, ensuring that the rate of energy extraction does not exceed the rate at which the underground reservoirs are naturally replenished by rainwater.

### Comprehension & Critical Thinking Questions

1.  What geological process occurs to the east of the North Island?
    A) Two plates moving apart from each other.
    B) Two plates grinding past each other.
    C) One plate being forced underneath another.
    D) The formation of new tectonic plates.

2.  (Numeracy) Out of the 20,000 earthquakes experienced each year, what percentage is strong enough to be felt?

    **Answer:**

3.  What is the primary advantage of geothermal energy over wind and solar power, according to the text?
    A) It is cheaper to build the power plants.
    B) It is more reliable and not dependent on the weather.
    C) It can only be used in the South Island.
    D) It produces more energy than all other sources combined.

4.  (Critical Thinking) How is the geological process that causes earthquakes and volcanoes also beneficial to New Zealand?

5.  (Critical Thinking) The text mentions the need to manage geothermal resources "sustainably." What might be the consequences if a geothermal reservoir is not managed sustainably?
