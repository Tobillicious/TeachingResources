## What is the Treaty of Waitangi?

The Treaty of Waitangi (Te Tiriti o Waitangi) is the founding document of New Zealand. It was first signed on **February 6, 1840**, by representatives of the British Crown and various Māori chiefs.

## Key Figures

- **William Hobson:** Represented the British Crown.
- **James Busby:** The British Resident who helped draft the Treaty.
- **Henry Williams:** A missionary who translated the Treaty into Māori.
- **Hōne Heke:** One of the first Māori chiefs to sign the Treaty.

## Two Versions, Two Meanings

A crucial aspect of the Treaty is that there are two versions: one in English and one in Māori. These versions are not exact translations of each other, which has led to significant disagreement over the centuries.

### The English Version
- **Article 1:** Māori leaders gave the Queen of England "all the rights and powers of Sovereignty".
- **Article 2:** Guaranteed Māori "the full exclusive and undisturbed possession of their Lands and Estates, Forests, Fisheries and other properties".
- **Article 3:** Granted Māori all the rights and privileges of British subjects.

### The Māori Version (Te Tiriti)
- **Article 1:** Māori leaders gave the Queen "kāwanatanga" (governance), which was understood as the power to make laws for peace and order, not full sovereignty.
- **Article 2:** Guaranteed Māori "te tino rangatiratanga" (the unqualified exercise of their chieftainship) over their lands, villages, and all their treasures ("taonga").
- **Article 3:** Granted Māori the same rights as people in England.

## The Principles of the Treaty

Today, the Treaty is interpreted through a set of principles, including:
- **Partnership:** The Crown and Māori should act reasonably and in good faith.
- **Participation:** The duty to consult with Māori on matters that affect them.
- **Protection:** The duty to actively protect Māori interests.

## The Waitangi Tribunal

Established in 1975, the Waitangi Tribunal is a permanent commission of inquiry that makes recommendations on claims brought by Māori relating to breaches of the promises made in the Treaty.
