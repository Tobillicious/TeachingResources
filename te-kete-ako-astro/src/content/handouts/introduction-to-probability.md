## Summary

This handout provides an introduction to the basic concepts of probability. Students will learn about the probability scale, how to calculate the probability of an event, and apply these concepts to various practice problems involving marbles, spinners, and real-world scenarios. The handout aims to build foundational understanding in statistical literacy and critical thinking about chance.

**Key Concepts Covered:**
*   The probability scale (Impossible to Certain).
*   Formula for calculating probability.
*   Applying probability to different scenarios.

## Overview for Kaiako

**LEARNING AREA:** Mathematics (Statistics)

**YEAR LEVEL:** Year 7-9 (adaptable for Year 10-13 with more complex problems)

**CURRICULUM LINKS:** Supports Achievement Objectives related to investigating and interpreting statistical information; understanding chance and probability; making predictions based on data (NZC Mathematics, Level 3/4; Te Mataiaho: Te Ao Tau - Mathematics).

**KEY COMPETENCIES:** Thinking (analyzing situations, calculating probabilities, problem-solving), Managing Self (systematic approach to problem-solving), Participating and Contributing (discussing probability in real-world contexts), Using Language, Symbols, and Texts (interpreting probability notation, understanding mathematical concepts).

**VALUES:** Whanaungatanga (collaborative problem-solving, understanding shared experiences of chance), Manaakitanga (creating an inclusive learning environment for mathematical exploration), Whaiora (fostering curiosity and enjoyment in mathematics), T≈´rangawaewae (connecting probability concepts to local events, games, or cultural practices where chance plays a role).

**CULTURAL CONSIDERATIONS & ADAPTATIONS:** Use examples of probability from traditional MƒÅori games (e.g., tƒ´ rƒÅkau, kƒ´-o-rahi) or Pasifika games; discuss how different cultures might perceive or describe chance and uncertainty; ensure word problems and scenarios are culturally relevant and relatable to the diverse student body of Mangakotukutuku College (e.g., probability of drawing a specific kapa haka uniform piece, or a certain type of fruit from a shared lunchbox); emphasize that mathematics is a universal language that can describe phenomena across all cultures.

## The Probability Scale

Probability is the measure of how likely an event is to occur. It is expressed as a number between 0 and 1.

| Impossible | Unlikely | Even Chance | Likely | Certain |
| :--------- | :------- | :---------- | :----- | :------ |
| 0          |          | 0.5 or 1/2  |        | 1       |

*   **0 (Impossible):** The event will definitely not happen. (e.g., The sun will rise in the west tomorrow).
*   **0.5 or 1/2 (Even Chance):** The event is equally likely to happen or not happen. (e.g., A coin flip landing on heads).
*   **1 (Certain):** The event will definitely happen. (e.g., The sun will rise in the east tomorrow).

## Calculating Probability

The probability of an event is calculated with this formula:

**P(event) = Number of favourable outcomes / Total number of possible outcomes**

*   **Favourable outcome:** The specific outcome you are interested in.
*   **Total possible outcomes:** All the different outcomes that could happen.

For example, the probability of rolling a 4 on a standard six-sided die is 1/6, because there is one '4' and six possible outcomes in total (1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6).

### Example: Rolling a Die

*   What is the probability of rolling an even number on a standard six-sided die?
    *   Favourable outcomes: 2, 4, 6 (3 outcomes)
    *   Total possible outcomes: 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6 (6 outcomes)
    *   P(even number) = 3/6 = 1/2

## Probability Practice üé≤

1.  A bag contains 5 red marbles, 3 blue marbles, and 2 green marbles.
    *   Total marbles: 5 + 3 + 2 = 10
    a) What is the probability of pulling out a blue marble?
    b) What is the probability of pulling out a red marble?
    c) Is it more likely to pull a red or a blue marble?

2.  You spin a spinner with 8 equal sections numbered 1-8.
    a) What is the probability of landing on an even number?
    b) What is the probability of landing on a number greater than 5?

3.  Mark the following events on the probability scale below (0, 0.5, 1).
    A) You will have homework this week.
    B) A coin flip will land on heads.
    C) It will snow in Auckland in July.

    Impossible (0) --- Even Chance (0.5) --- Certain (1)
