## A Timeline of Key Conflicts

The New Zealand Wars were a series of armed conflicts that took place in New Zealand from 1845 to 1872 between the New Zealand colonial government and allied Māori on one side, and other Māori and Māori-allied groups on the other.

### 1845-1846: The Northern War
- **Cause:** Discontent over British authority, centered around the flagstaff at Kororāreka (Russell).
- **Key Figure:** Hōne Heke.
- **Outcome:** A stalemate, but it established the pattern of conflict over land and sovereignty.

### 1860-1861: The First Taranaki War
- **Cause:** A disputed land sale at Waitara.
- **Key Event:** The British assault on Te Ātiawa's Pukerangiora pā.
- **Outcome:** An uneasy truce, with the underlying issues unresolved.

### 1863-1866: The Waikato War
- **The Largest Conflict:** A full-scale invasion of the Waikato by British forces.
- **Key Figure:** King Tāwhiao, the second Māori King.
- **Key Event:** The Battle of Rangiriri (1863) and the Battle of Ōrākau (1864).
- **Outcome:** Massive land confiscations (raupatu) from Waikato iwi.

### 1864-1868: The Tauranga Campaign
- **Key Event:** The Battle of Gate Pā (Pukehinahina), a significant Māori victory against a much larger British force.
- **Significance:** Showcased the effectiveness of modern pā construction.

### 1868-1872: The Wars of Te Kooti and Tītokowaru
- **Key Figures:** Te Kooti Arikirangi Te Tūruki and Riwha Tītokowaru.
