## Summary

This handout provides a reading comprehension text that explores the author's purpose to inform, using the unique New Zealand kea as its subject. Students will analyze how factual information is presented, identify key characteristics of informational writing, and engage with critical thinking questions about the text's content and purpose.

**Key Concepts Covered:**
*   Defining informing as an author's purpose.
*   Identifying characteristics of informational texts (e.g., facts, statistics, objective tone, technical language).
*   Analyzing how authors use structure and language to convey information clearly.

## Overview for Kaiako

**LEARNING AREA:** English (primary), Science (secondary)

**YEAR LEVEL:** Year 9-13

**CURRICULUM LINKS:** Supports Achievement Objectives related to comprehending and analyzing texts; understanding how authors use language features and structures to achieve purpose and audience; developing critical literacy skills (NZC English, Level 4/5; Te Mataiaho: Te Ao Reo - Language and Communication, Te Ao Tūroa - The Natural World).

**KEY COMPETENCIES:** Thinking (analyzing informational texts, interpreting factual data, critical evaluation), Using Language, Symbols, and Texts (interpreting scientific language, understanding objective tone), Managing Self (applying analytical strategies), Participating and Contributing (discussing interpretations of the text).

**VALUES:** Whanaungatanga (connecting through shared knowledge, understanding diverse perspectives on nature), Manaakitanga (caring for the environment, appreciating unique species), Whaiora (fostering curiosity and a love for learning about the natural world), Tūrangawaewae (connecting the text to the unique biodiversity of Aotearoa New Zealand, understanding the significance of native species like the kea).

**CULTURAL CONSIDERATIONS & ADAPTATIONS:** Discuss the kea's significance in Māori culture (e.g., its intelligence, mischievousness, and place in local iwi narratives); explore how mātauranga Māori (Māori knowledge) contributes to our understanding of native species and conservation; use the text as a springboard to discuss the importance of protecting native New Zealand wildlife and the role of kaitiakitanga (guardianship); encourage students to share their own knowledge or experiences with native birds or conservation efforts.

## Kea: The World's Only Alpine Parrot

The kea (*Nestor notabilis*) is a species of large parrot found in the forested and alpine regions of the South Island of New Zealand. Renowned for its intelligence and curiosity, the kea is one of the most unique birds in the world. Measuring up to 48 cm in length and weighing up to 1 kg, its plumage is primarily olive-green, with a brilliant flash of orange-red under its wings. This striking feature is most visible when the bird is in flight. Kea are social birds and typically live in groups of up to 15 individuals.

Unlike most parrots that prefer tropical climates, the kea has adapted to survive in a harsh alpine environment. Its diet is omnivorous and highly varied, including roots, leaves, berries, nectar, insects, and carrion. This adaptability is a key factor in its survival. Kea possess a strong, curved beak, which is not only used for cracking nuts but also for digging, manipulating objects, and exploring its environment. Scientific studies have demonstrated the kea's remarkable problem-solving abilities, with some researchers comparing its intelligence to that of a young primate. They are known to work together to achieve a common goal and can solve complex puzzles to obtain food.

The conservation status of the kea is currently listed as 'Nationally Endangered'. The wild population is estimated to be between 3,000 and 7,000 individuals. The primary threats to the species include predation by introduced mammals such as stoats and possums, which prey on eggs and chicks in their nests. Historically, kea were also persecuted by farmers who believed they attacked sheep. A government-sponsored bounty system resulted in the deaths of an estimated 150,000 kea before it was abolished in 1970. Today, conservation efforts focus on predator control and scientific research to better understand and protect this iconic New Zealand species.

### Analysing Informational Techniques

1.  What is the author's primary purpose in writing this text?
    A) To persuade readers to donate to kea conservation.
    B) To inform readers about the characteristics and status of the kea.
    C) To entertain readers with a fictional story about a clever parrot.
    D) To argue that kea are more intelligent than primates.

2.  (Numeracy) What is the range of the estimated wild kea population mentioned in the text?

    **Answer:**

3.  The text uses the scientific name *Nestor notabilis*. What is the purpose of including this type of specific, technical language?
    A) To make the text more entertaining and story-like.
    B) To confuse the reader with difficult words.
    C) To add precision and credibility to the information.
    D) To persuade the reader to become a scientist.

4.  (Critical Thinking) How does the author maintain a neutral, objective tone throughout the text? Provide an example of a sentence that is purely informational.

5.  (Critical Thinking) The text presents facts about the threats to kea. While the author's primary purpose is to inform, could this information also have a secondary, persuasive effect on the reader? Explain your reasoning.
