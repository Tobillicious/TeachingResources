## Inside a Plant Cell

Plant cells are the basic building blocks of plants. They have several specialized parts called **organelles** that each have a specific job.

*(A diagram of a plant cell would be included here in a full resource)*

### Key Organelles and Their Functions

1.  **Cell Wall:** A rigid outer layer made of cellulose that provides structural support and protection to the cell. Animal cells do not have a cell wall.
2.  **Cell Membrane:** Located just inside the cell wall, it controls what substances can enter and leave the cell.
3.  **Nucleus:** The "control center" of the cell. It contains the cell's genetic material (DNA), which holds the instructions for everything the cell does.
4.  **Chloroplasts:** These are the organelles where **photosynthesis** happens. They contain a green pigment called chlorophyll, which captures energy from the sun. Animal cells do not have chloroplasts.
5.  **Vacuole:** A large, water-filled sac that stores water, nutrients, and waste products. It helps to maintain pressure inside the cell, keeping it firm.
6.  **Mitochondrion (plural: mitochondria):** The "powerhouse" of the cell. This is where cellular respiration occurs, breaking down glucose to release energy for the cell to use.
7.  **Cytoplasm:** The jelly-like substance that fills the cell and surrounds the organelles.
