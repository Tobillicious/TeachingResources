## What is the UDHR?

The Universal Declaration of Human Rights (UDHR) is a document that was adopted by the United Nations General Assembly on **December 10, 1948**. It was created in the aftermath of World War II and represents the first global expression of rights to which all human beings are inherently entitled.

## Key Principles

The UDHR is based on the fundamental principle that **all human beings are born free and equal in dignity and rights**. It is not a legally binding treaty, but it serves as a common standard of achievement for all peoples and all nations.

## Summary of Key Articles

The UDHR contains 30 articles that outline specific rights and freedoms. Here are a few examples:

-   **Article 1:** All human beings are born free and equal in dignity and rights.
-   **Article 3:** Everyone has the right to life, liberty, and security of person.
-   **Article 4:** No one shall be held in slavery or servitude.
-   **Article 5:** No one shall be subjected to torture or to cruel, inhuman or degrading treatment or punishment.
-   **Article 18:** Everyone has the right to freedom of thought, conscience and religion.
-   **Article 19:** Everyone has the right to freedom of opinion and expression.
-   **Article 26:** Everyone has the right to education.

## New Zealand's Role

New Zealand was an active participant in the drafting of the UDHR and was one of the 48 countries that voted in favor of its adoption in 1948. The principles of the UDHR are reflected in New Zealand law, particularly the **New Zealand Bill of Rights Act 1990** and the **Human Rights Act 1993**.
