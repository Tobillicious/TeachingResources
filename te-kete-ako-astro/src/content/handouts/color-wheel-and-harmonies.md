## The Color Wheel

The color wheel is a visual tool that helps us understand the relationships between colors.

### Primary Colors
These are the three fundamental colors that cannot be made by mixing other colors together.
-   **Red**
-   **Yellow**
-   **Blue**

### Secondary Colors
These are created by mixing two primary colors.
-   **Orange** (Red + Yellow)
-   **Green** (Yellow + Blue)
-   **Violet** (Blue + Red)

### Tertiary Colors
These are created by mixing a primary color with a secondary color next to it on the color wheel.
-   Red-Orange
-   Yellow-Orange
-   Yellow-Green
-   Blue-Green
-   Blue-Violet
-   Red-Violet

## Color Harmonies

Color harmonies are combinations of colors that are considered pleasing to the eye.

### Complementary Colors
Colors that are directly opposite each other on the color wheel (e.g., **Red and Green**). They create high contrast.

### Analogous Colors
Colors that are next to each other on the color wheel (e.g., **Red, Red-Orange, and Orange**). They create a sense of unity and calm.

### Triadic Colors
Three colors that are evenly spaced around the color wheel (e.g., **Red, Yellow, and Blue**). They create a vibrant, balanced look.

## Warm vs. Cool Colors

-   **Warm Colors:** Reds, Oranges, Yellows. They tend to feel energetic and advance in space.
-   **Cool Colors:** Blues, Greens, Violets. They tend to feel calm and recede in space.
