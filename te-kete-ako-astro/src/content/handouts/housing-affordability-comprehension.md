The handout encourages critical thinking about potential solutions and the broader implications for fairness, equality, and well-being in Aotearoa.

**Key Concepts Covered:**
*   Definition and indicators of housing affordability crisis.
*   Factors contributing to high housing costs (supply, demand, policy).
*   Social consequences of housing unaffordability (overcrowding, instability).
*   Potential solutions and policy debates.

## Reading Comprehension: The Housing Crisis

### The Great Aotearoa Home Ownership Dream

For generations, owning a home has been a cornerstone of the New Zealand dream. However, for many young people today, this dream feels increasingly out of reach. New Zealand is currently facing a severe **housing affordability crisis**, meaning that the cost of buying or renting a home is extremely high relative to average incomes. In 2023, a report from Demographia International found Auckland to be the 9th least affordable city for housing in the world, with the median house price being over 11 times the median household income. A widely accepted benchmark for affordable housing is a ratio of 3.0 or less.

Several complex factors have contributed to this situation. For decades, the **supply** of new houses has not kept up with population growth, creating a fundamental shortage. This is partly due to strict planning rules and a lack of available land for development. At the same time, **demand** has been fuelled by low interest rates (making it cheaper to borrow money) and the view of housing as a secure financial investment. This combination of high demand and low supply has inevitably driven prices skyward, benefiting existing homeowners but creating a major barrier for those trying to enter the market.

The social consequences of this crisis are profound. High rental costs consume a large portion of household incomes, leaving less money for other essentials like food, healthcare, and education. It can lead to overcrowding and housing instability, which disproportionately affects low-income families and children. In response, various solutions are being debated, including government-led building programs (like KiwiBuild), changes to planning laws to encourage urban density, and policies aimed at discouraging property investment. Tackling this issue is one of the most significant challenges facing Aotearoa, as it strikes at the heart of fairness, equality, and the wellbeing of future generations.

### Comprehension & Critical Thinking Questions

1.  What is the main definition of a housing affordability crisis according to the text?
    A) When there are not enough houses for people to live in.
    B) When the cost of housing is very high compared to average incomes.
    C) When interest rates for borrowing money are too high.
    D) When people prefer to rent rather than buy houses.

2.  (Numeracy) If the median house price in Auckland is 11 times the median income of $90,000, what is the median house price?

    **Answer:**

3.  Which of these is NOT a factor mentioned in the text as contributing to the housing crisis?
    A) A lack of new houses being built.
    B) Low interest rates making borrowing easier.
    C) A decrease in the country's population.
    D) Strict planning rules.

4.  (Critical Thinking) The text states that the housing crisis "disproportionately affects low-income families." Explain why this would be the case.

5.  (Critical Thinking) The text mentions "changes to planning laws to encourage urban density" as a potential solution. What could be one advantage and one disadvantage of building more high-density housing (like apartment buildings) in cities?
