## Summary

This handout introduces students to the seven fundamental elements of art: Line, Shape, Form, Colour, Texture, Space, and Value. Each element is defined and illustrated, providing a foundational understanding for creating and analyzing visual artworks. The handout includes practical activities to encourage students to identify and apply these elements in their own creative work and in analyzing existing art.

**Key Concepts Covered:**
*   Definitions and examples of Line, Shape, Form, Colour, Texture, Space, and Value.
*   How these elements are used as building blocks in art.
*   Analyzing artworks based on their use of elements.

## Overview for Kaiako

**LEARNING AREA:** The Arts (Visual Arts)

**YEAR LEVEL:** Year 7-9 (adaptable for Year 10-13 with deeper analysis)

**CURRICULUM LINKS:** Supports Achievement Objectives related to developing practical art-making skills; understanding and applying elements and principles of art; analyzing and interpreting artworks from various contexts; understanding the role of art in society and culture (NZC The Arts, Level 3/4; Te Mataiaho: Te Ao Rehua - The Arts).

**KEY COMPETENCIES:** Thinking (analyzing visual information, creative problem-solving, critical evaluation), Managing Self (experimenting with art materials, developing artistic skills), Participating and Contributing (sharing artistic creations, discussing interpretations), Using Language, Symbols, and Texts (interpreting visual symbols, communicating artistic ideas).

**VALUES:** Whanaungatanga (collaborative art projects, appreciating diverse artistic expressions), Manaakitanga (caring for art materials, respecting artistic efforts), Whaiora (fostering creativity, self-expression, and enjoyment in art-making), T콞rangawaewae (connecting art elements to traditional M캐ori and Pasifika art forms, exploring local artists and their use of elements).

**CULTURAL CONSIDERATIONS & ADAPTATIONS:** Discuss how the elements of art are present and utilized in traditional M캐ori art forms (e.g., the significance of line and shape in k콄whaiwhai and t캐 moko, the use of colour in tukutuku panels, the concept of space in marae design); encourage students to create artworks inspired by their own cultural heritage, applying the elements of art; use examples of artworks by M캐ori and Pasifika artists to illustrate the concepts; ensure discussions are inclusive and celebrate diverse artistic traditions.

## The Elements of Art

The Elements of Art are the basic visual components that an artist uses to create a work of art. They are the building blocks, like ingredients in a recipe or words in a sentence.

*   **Line**
    A mark made on a surface. Lines can be straight, curved, thick, thin, zig-zag, dashed, implied, etc. They can create outlines, textures, and direct the viewer's eye.

*   **Shape**
    A 2D (two-dimensional) area enclosed by a line. Shapes have height and width. They can be:
    *   **Geometric:** Precise, mathematical shapes (e.g., squares, circles, triangles).
    *   **Organic:** Free-form, irregular shapes found in nature (e.g., leaves, clouds, puddles).

*   **Form**
    A 3D (three-dimensional) object that has height, width, and depth. Forms can be geometric (e.g., cubes, spheres, pyramids) or organic (e.g., a tree, a human body).

*   **Colour**
    The element of art that is produced when light, striking an object, is reflected back to the eye. Colour has three main properties:
    *   **Hue:** The pure colour (e.g., red, blue, yellow).
    *   **Value:** The lightness or darkness of a colour.
    *   **Intensity/Saturation:** The brightness or dullness of a colour.

*   **Texture**
    The way something feels or looks like it would feel. It can be actual (you can feel it) or implied (it looks like it has a certain texture).
    *   *Examples:* Rough, smooth, bumpy, soft, prickly.

*   **Space**
    The area around, between, or within elements of an artwork. It can be positive (the subject itself) or negative (the empty space around the subject). Space creates depth and perspective.

*   **Value**
    The lightness or darkness of a colour. It helps create depth, form, and contrast in an artwork. A value scale shows a gradual transition from white to black.
