## Summary

This handout provides a reading comprehension text that delves into the ethical issues surrounding AI-generated art. It prompts critical thinking on concepts of authorship, copyright, and the evolving definition of creativity in the age of artificial intelligence, encouraging students to develop and articulate their own informed viewpoints.

**Key Concepts Covered:**
*   Definition and capabilities of AI art generators.
*   Concerns regarding AI training data and copyright.
*   The debate over whether AI-generated images can be considered "art."
*   Ethical questions about intention, emotion, and lived experience in artistic creation.

## Overview for Kaiako

**LEARNING AREA:** Digital Technologies (primary), The Arts, Social Sciences (secondary)

**YEAR LEVEL:** Year 10-13

**CURRICULUM LINKS:** Supports Achievement Objectives related to understanding digital systems and their societal impact, analyzing artistic works, and developing critical thinking skills to evaluate complex issues (NZC Digital Technologies, Progress Outcome 4/5; The Arts, Level 5; Social Sciences, Level 5; Te Mataiaho: Te Ao Hangarau - Digital Technologies, Te Ao Tangata - Social Sciences, Te Ao Rehua - The Arts).

**KEY COMPETENCIES:** Thinking (critically evaluating information, forming reasoned arguments), Managing Self (developing informed opinions, engaging with complex ideas), Participating and Contributing (engaging in respectful ethical discussions).

**VALUES:** Whanaungatanga (building respectful relationships through ethical discussion, understanding diverse perspectives on creativity and ownership), Manaakitanga (caring for artists and their intellectual property, considering the impact of AI on livelihoods), Whaiora (fostering creativity and innovation responsibly), Tūrangawaewae (discussing the intellectual property of Māori and Pasifika art forms, and the potential for cultural appropriation in AI-generated content).

**CULTURAL CONSIDERATIONS & ADAPTATIONS:** This handout can be used to spark discussions on intellectual property and cultural appropriation in relation to Māori and Pasifika art forms (e.g., kōwhaiwhai, tā moko, weaving patterns) and how AI might misuse or misrepresent them. Encourage students to explore the idea of authorship and creativity from diverse cultural perspectives, including indigenous views on collective ownership of knowledge and art. Facilitate discussions on how AI art might impact traditional artists and cultural practices within their own communities, ensuring all viewpoints are heard and respected.

## Reading Comprehension: The AI Art Debate

### Can a Machine Be an Artist?

In 2022, a new wave of Artificial Intelligence (AI) tools emerged that could generate stunningly detailed images from simple text prompts. Users could type "a photorealistic astronaut riding a horse on Mars" and receive a unique, complex image in seconds. These AI art generators, such as Midjourney and DALL-E 2, have sparked a fierce debate in the art world. Proponents hail them as revolutionary tools for creativity, allowing anyone to visualise their ideas, regardless of their technical drawing skill. They argue that AI is simply a new paintbrush, a sophisticated instrument that opens up new artistic possibilities.

However, many human artists and designers are deeply concerned. A major point of contention is how these AI models are trained. They learn by analysing vast datasets containing millions of images scraped from the internet, many of which are copyrighted works by human artists. These artists argue that the AI is essentially "copying" their style and labour without their consent or compensation. For example, an AI can be prompted to create an image "in the style of Weta Workshop" or "like a Rita Angus painting," raising complex questions about artistic ownership and copyright law.

The central question is whether AI-generated images can truly be considered "art." Does art require intention, emotion, and lived experience, or is it purely about the final product? If an AI cannot feel joy or sorrow, can it create a genuinely joyful or sorrowful image? This debate challenges our very definition of creativity. As this technology becomes more sophisticated, it forces us to consider what we value most in art: the aesthetic beauty of the image itself, or the human story and skill behind its creation. There are no easy answers, and the conversation is set to reshape our understanding of art for years to come.

### Comprehension & Critical Thinking Questions

1.  **What is the main argument in favour of AI art generators, according to the text?**
    *   A) They are a faster way to copy existing famous paintings.
    *   B) They are a new tool that can help anyone be creative.
    *   C) They will make human artists obsolete.
    *   D) They are only used for creating photorealistic images.

2.  **What is the primary concern that human artists have about how AI models are trained?**
    *   A) The AI models are not powerful enough to learn properly.
    *   B) The AI uses too much electricity during training.
    *   C) The AI learns from their copyrighted work without permission.
    *   D) The AI can only generate images in one specific style.

3.  **The text asks if art requires "intention, emotion, and lived experience." What is the best synonym for "intention" in this context?**
    *   A) An accident
    *   B) A purpose or a plan
    *   C) A beautiful outcome
    *   D) A technical skill

4.  **(Critical Thinking) The text compares an AI art generator to "a new paintbrush." Do you think this is a fair comparison? Explain why or why not.**

5.  **(Critical Thinking) Who do you think should own the copyright to an image created by an AI: the person who wrote the prompt, the company that created the AI, or the artists whose work was used in the training data? Justify your choice.**
