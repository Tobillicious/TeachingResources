## Core Pillars of Digital Citizenship

Digital citizenship is about being a responsible, ethical, and safe member of the online world. It involves understanding your rights and responsibilities in digital spaces.

*   **👣 Digital Footprint**
    This is the trail of data you leave behind online. It includes social media posts, search history, photos you've shared, and even websites you visit. Everything you do online leaves a trace. **Think before you post!** Once something is online, it's very difficult to remove completely.

*   **😠 Cyberbullying**
    Using digital technology (like social media, messaging apps, or online games) to deliberately and repeatedly hurt, harass, or embarrass someone. It can take many forms, including spreading rumors, posting hurtful comments, or excluding someone online. It's never okay. **Be an upstander, not a bystander.** If you see cyberbullying, report it and support the person being targeted.

*   **🔒 Privacy & Security**
    Protecting your personal information (like your full name, address, phone number, passwords, and photos). This also includes keeping your devices safe from unauthorized access. Use strong, unique passwords, enable two-factor authentication, and be careful what you share.

*   **🤔 Critical Thinking**
    Questioning what you see and read online. Is this information reliable? Is this person who they say they are? Not everything on the internet is true or accurate. Develop a healthy skepticism and learn to verify information from multiple credible sources.

## T.H.I.N.K. Before You Post

Before you post or share anything online, take a moment to T.H.I.N.K.:

*   **T** - Is it **True?** (Is the information accurate and factual?)
*   **H** - Is it **Helpful?** (Does it contribute positively to the conversation or situation?)
*   **I** - Is it **Inspiring?** (Does it uplift or encourage others?)
*   **N** - Is it **Necessary?** (Does it need to be said? Is it relevant?)
*   **K** - Is it **Kind?** (Is it respectful and considerate of others' feelings?)

## Scenario Analysis 🧐

Discuss these scenarios and consider the best course of action:

*   **Scenario 1:** Your friend posts an embarrassing photo of you online as a joke. It's getting a lot of likes and comments. What should you do?
    *   *Consider:* How does this make you feel? What are your options for dealing with your friend and the photo? Who can you talk to for help?

*   **Scenario 2:** You receive a friend request from someone you don't know. They have a lot of mutual friends. Should you accept?
    *   *Consider:* What are the risks of accepting? How can you verify their identity? What information might they gain access to?

*   **Scenario 3:** You see a mean comment about another student on a group chat. What are your options?
    *   *Consider:* What is your responsibility as an upstander? How can you support the targeted student? What are the potential consequences of ignoring it?
