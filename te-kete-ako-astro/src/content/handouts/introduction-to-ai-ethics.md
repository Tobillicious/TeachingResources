## Summary

This handout provides a foundational overview of AI ethics, exploring the moral issues that arise from the development and use of artificial intelligence. It outlines key ethical considerations such as bias and fairness, transparency, privacy, accountability, and human control. The handout aims to foster critical thinking about the societal impact of AI and promote responsible innovation.

**Key Concepts Covered:**
*   Definition of AI ethics.
*   Key ethical considerations: Bias and Fairness, Transparency and Explainability, Privacy and Data Security, Accountability, Human Control and Autonomy.
*   Importance of addressing AI ethics for responsible development.

## Overview for Kaiako

**LEARNING AREA:** Digital Technologies (primary), Social Sciences (secondary)

**YEAR LEVEL:** Year 9-13

**CURRICULUM LINKS:** Supports Achievement Objectives related to understanding how digital systems work and their impact on society; exploring the ethical implications of emerging technologies; understanding diverse perspectives on technological development (NZC Digital Technologies, Progress Outcome 4/5; Social Sciences, Level 5; Te Mataiaho: Te Ao Hangarau - Digital Technologies, Te Ao Tangata - Social Sciences).

**KEY COMPETENCIES:** Thinking (analyzing ethical dilemmas, critical evaluation, problem-solving), Managing Self (developing informed opinions, engaging with complex ideas), Participating and Contributing (engaging in respectful ethical discussions, understanding societal impact), Using Language, Symbols, and Texts (interpreting technical and ethical concepts, articulating ideas).

**VALUES:** Whanaungatanga (understanding AI's impact on communities, fostering inclusive technological development), Manaakitanga (caring for people's well-being in an AI-driven world, addressing bias), Whaiora (fostering curiosity and innovation responsibly), Tūrangawaewae (connecting AI ethics to local contexts, discussing data sovereignty for Māori/Pasifika, exploring ethical frameworks from diverse cultural perspectives).

**CULTURAL CONSIDERATIONS & ADAPTATIONS:** Discuss how AI ethics impacts Māori and Pasifika communities, including issues of data sovereignty, algorithmic bias, and the potential for AI to support or diminish cultural practices (e.g., Te Reo Māori language models, facial recognition on cultural groups); explore ethical frameworks from diverse cultural perspectives when discussing AI's benefits and challenges; use examples of AI applications in New Zealand industries or research that are relevant to students' backgrounds; encourage students to consider how AI can be developed and used in ways that are culturally appropriate and beneficial to all communities.

## What is AI Ethics?

**AI ethics** is a field that studies the moral issues that arise from the development and use of artificial intelligence. As AI becomes more integrated into our daily lives, it's crucial to consider its impact on society, individuals, and the environment. It asks: *Just because we can build it, should we? And if so, how?*

### Key Ethical Considerations:

1.  **Bias and Fairness:** AI systems learn from data. If the data they are trained on is biased (e.g., reflecting historical inequalities), the AI can perpetuate or even amplify existing societal biases. Ensuring fairness means striving for equitable outcomes for all individuals, regardless of their background.
2.  **Transparency and Explainability:** Many advanced AI models are like "black boxes"—it can be difficult to understand *how* they make decisions. Transparency and explainability aim to make AI systems more understandable, interpretable, and accountable, especially in critical applications like healthcare or justice.
3.  **Privacy and Data Security:** AI often relies on vast amounts of personal data. This raises significant concerns about how personal information is collected, stored, used, and protected. Who owns your data? How is it being used?
4.  **Accountability:** Who is responsible when an AI system makes a mistake or causes harm? Is it the developer, the user, the company, or the AI itself? Establishing clear lines of accountability is essential as AI becomes more autonomous.
5.  **Human Control and Autonomy:** As AI systems become more intelligent and autonomous, there are questions about maintaining human oversight and ensuring that AI serves human values and goals, rather than operating without human intervention in critical areas.

### Why is AI Ethics Important?

Addressing AI ethics is vital to ensure that AI development benefits humanity and avoids unintended negative consequences. It helps build trust in AI technologies, promotes responsible innovation, and ensures that AI aligns with our societal values and human rights. It's about shaping a future where AI is a tool for good.
