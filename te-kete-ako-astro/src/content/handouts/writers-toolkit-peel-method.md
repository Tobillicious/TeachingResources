## What is the PEEL Method?

How do you build an argument that is logical, convincing, and easy for your reader to follow? A powerful tool used in persuasive writing is the **PEEL paragraph structure**. PEEL is an acronym that stands for **P**oint, **E**vidence, **E**xplanation, and **L**ink. It provides a clear framework for each paragraph, ensuring that you don't just state your opinion, but you support it with facts and connect it back to your main argument. Using PEEL helps to create well-structured, persuasive essays and speeches.

### Deconstructing a PEEL Paragraph

Let's break down each part of a PEEL paragraph:

*   **P - Point**
    The main idea or argument of your paragraph. It should be a clear topic sentence that states the argument you are about to make. This is your claim.

    *Example: School uniforms should be compulsory as they promote a sense of equality among students.*

*   **E - Evidence**
    The facts, statistics, examples, quotes, or data that support your point. This is your proof. Evidence makes your argument credible.

    *Example: A 2021 study by the New Zealand Council for Educational Research found that in schools with uniforms, 78% of students reported lower levels of anxiety related to their appearance.*

*   **E - Explanation**
    Explain how your evidence proves your point. This is where you analyze the information, elaborate on your reasoning, and show your thinking. Don't just state the evidence; explain its significance.

    *Example: This shows that when all students are dressed the same, there is less pressure to keep up with fashion trends, which reduces social judgment and allows students to focus on their learning.*

*   **L - Link**
    Connect your point back to the main topic or thesis of your essay. It summarizes the paragraph's argument and transitions smoothly to the next paragraph or the overall conclusion.

    *Example: Therefore, implementing a uniform policy is a key step in creating a more inclusive and less stressful school environment for everyone.*

### Deconstruction & Application

1.  **Deconstruction:** Read the paragraph below and identify the P, E, E, and L components.

    *Allowing cell phones in classrooms can be a major distraction from learning. For example, a recent survey showed that students spend an average of 25 minutes per day on non-academic activities on their phones during class time. This time spent on social media or games is time taken directly away from valuable instruction and focused work, ultimately hindering academic progress. Consequently, to maintain a productive learning environment, cell phone use must be restricted during lessons.*

    **Point:** ____________________
    **Evidence:** ____________________
    **Explanation:** ____________________
    **Link:** ____________________

2.  **Application:** Use the PEEL framework to write a paragraph arguing that all students should be required to learn Te Reo Māori. (You can invent reasonable evidence for this task, or use general knowledge).
