## Summary

This handout introduces students to the fundamental creative writing principle of "Show, Don't Tell." It explains how to convey emotions, settings, and character traits through actions, dialogue, and sensory details rather than direct statements. Through clear examples and practical exercises, students will learn to transform their writing from informative to immersive, creating a more engaging experience for their readers.

**Key Concepts Covered:**
*   Definition and importance of "Show, Don't Tell."
*   Comparison of "telling" vs. "showing" examples.
*   Techniques for showing (sensory details, actions, dialogue).
*   Application in creative writing.

**CULTURAL CONSIDERATIONS & ADAPTATIONS:** Discuss how traditional MƒÅori and Pasifika oral traditions and storytelling often rely heavily on vivid description and sensory details to immerse listeners; encourage students to draw on their own cultural experiences, local landscapes, and community events to create rich, authentic descriptions in their writing; explore how "showing" can be used to convey cultural nuances or emotions that might be difficult to "tell" directly; ensure examples are relatable and respectful of all students' backgrounds.

## What Does "Show, Don't Tell" Mean?

"**Show, Don't Tell**" is one of the most powerful rules in creative writing. Instead of simply telling the reader something is true (e.g., "The man was angry"), a good writer *shows* it through actions, dialogue, and sensory details, allowing the reader to experience the scene for themselves. Telling is direct and informative, but showing is immersive and entertaining. It invites the reader to become a detective, drawing their own conclusions from the evidence you provide. This technique is essential for creating a world that feels real and characters that come alive.

### Telling vs. Showing: An Example

**Telling** üò¥

The room was messy.

*This gives us the basic information, but it's boring. The reader has no connection to the space.*

**Showing** üòé

Week-old pizza boxes teetered on a stack of textbooks, and clothes were strewn across the floor like a colourful, fabric avalanche. The air was thick with the smell of stale coffee and dust.

*This uses specific details (pizza boxes, clothes) and sensory information (smell of coffee) to create a vivid picture of the mess.*

### Deconstruction & Application

1.  **Deconstruction:** Read the "Telling" sentence below. How could you "Show" this instead? Brainstorm sensory details (sight, sound, smell, touch, taste) and specific actions.

    **Telling Sentence:**
    *The girl was nervous about her speech.*

2.  **Application:** Rewrite the following short paragraph. Your goal is to replace the "Telling" parts with "Showing" details to make the scene more entertaining and immersive.

    *It was a very cold day. The old man walked down the street. He was poor but happy. He went into the warm bakery.*

3.  **(Critical Thinking)** Is "Telling" always bad? Can you think of a situation where a writer might deliberately choose to "Tell" instead of "Show"? (Hint: Think about efficiency, summarizing less important details, or maintaining a certain narrative distance).
