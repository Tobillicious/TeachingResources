## What is the pH Scale?

The pH scale measures how acidic or alkaline (basic) a substance is. The scale ranges from 0 to 14.

-   A pH of **7** is **neutral**.
-   A pH **less than 7** is **acidic**.
-   A pH **greater than 7** is **alkaline** or **basic**.

### **Acids (pH < 7)**

Acids are substances that have a high concentration of hydrogen ions. They often have a sour taste.

**Common Examples:**
-   **0:** Battery Acid
-   **1:** Stomach Acid
-   **2:** Lemon Juice
-   **3:** Vinegar
-   **5:** Black Coffee
-   **6:** Milk

### **Neutral (pH = 7)**

A neutral substance is neither acidic nor alkaline.

**Common Example:**
-   **7:** Pure Water

---

### **Alkalis / Bases (pH > 7)**

Alkalis (or bases) are substances that have a low concentration of hydrogen ions. They often feel soapy.

**Common Examples:**
-   **8:** Sea Water
-   **9:** Baking Soda
-   **11:** Ammonia Solution
-   **13:** Bleach
-   **14:** Drain Cleaner

### **Litmus Paper Test**

A simple way to test for pH is with litmus paper:
-   **Blue litmus paper** turns **red** in an acid.
-   **Red litmus paper** turns **blue** in an alkali.
