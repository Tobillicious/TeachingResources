## What is the Bill of Rights 1689?

The Bill of Rights is an act that the Parliament of England passed on December 16, 1689. It was a crucial step in the development of parliamentary democracy and constitutional monarchy in the United Kingdom.

## Historical Context: The Glorious Revolution

The Bill of Rights was a product of the **Glorious Revolution** of 1688, in which King James II was overthrown and replaced by his daughter Mary and her husband, William of Orange. The new monarchs agreed to accept the Bill of Rights as a condition of their rule.

## Key Provisions

The Bill of Rights asserted the supremacy of Parliament over the monarch and established a number of key rights and principles:

-   **Parliamentary Sovereignty:** It declared that the monarch could not suspend or create laws without the consent of Parliament.
-   **Free Elections:** It established the right to free elections for Members of Parliament.
-   **Freedom of Speech in Parliament:** It protected the right of MPs to freedom of speech and debate within Parliament.
-   **No Cruel or Unusual Punishment:** It forbade the imposition of excessive bail or fines, and cruel and unusual punishments.
-   **Right to Petition:** It affirmed the right of subjects to petition the monarch without fear of retribution.

## Legacy in New Zealand

The Bill of Rights 1689 is part of New Zealand's "unwritten" constitution. Its principles, particularly the supremacy of Parliament and the protection of individual liberties, are fundamental to New Zealand's legal and political system. The **New Zealand Bill of Rights Act 1990** affirms many of these same rights in a modern context.
