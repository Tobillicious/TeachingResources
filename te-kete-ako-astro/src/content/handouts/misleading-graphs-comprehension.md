## Summary

This handout provides a reading comprehension text that explores common techniques used to create misleading graphs and statistics, such as manipulating the Y-axis and cherry-picking data. Students will learn to critically evaluate data visualizations, identify potential biases, and understand the importance of statistical literacy in a data-rich world. The handout includes critical thinking questions that encourage students to question information and form informed judgments.

**Key Concepts Covered:**
*   Definition of misleading graphs.
*   Techniques for manipulating data visualization (Y-axis manipulation, cherry-picking).
*   The concept of a "lurking variable."
*   Importance of statistical literacy and critical evaluation of data.

## Reading Comprehension: Misleading Data

### When Numbers Lie

In a world saturated with information, we often rely on graphs and statistics to help us understand complex topics. From news reports to advertisements, data visualization is a powerful tool. However, this tool can be used to mislead as well as to inform. A **misleading graph** is one that distorts data to create a false impression. One of the most common techniques is manipulating the Y-axis (the vertical axis) on a bar or line graph. By starting the axis at a value other than zero, or by stretching or compressing the scale, small differences can be made to look enormous, or significant changes can be made to look trivial.

Consider two snack food companies. Company A sells 5,200 units and Company B sells 5,000 units. The actual difference is only 200 units, or 4% of Company B's sales. A truthful graph with a Y-axis starting at 0 would show two bars of very similar height. However, if a marketer for Company A creates a graph where the Y-axis starts at 4,800 and ends at 5,400, Company A's bar will appear to be more than twice as tall as Company B's. This visual trick exaggerates the difference and can mislead a consumer into thinking one product is vastly more popular than the other.

Another common issue is **cherry-picking data**. This involves selecting only the data that supports a particular argument while ignoring data that contradicts it. For example, a report might claim that "ice cream sales cause an increase in drownings" by showing that both rise in the summer. This ignores the **lurking variable**—the hot weather—that is the actual cause of both. Being statistically literate is a crucial skill in the modern world. It involves more than just reading the numbers; it requires us to question the source of the data, look at the scales on graphs, and think critically about what information might be missing.

### Comprehension & Critical Thinking Questions

1.  What is the most common technique for creating a misleading graph mentioned in the text?
    A) Using bright colours to distract the reader.
    B) Manipulating the Y-axis scale.
    C) Presenting too much data at once.
    D) Using a pie chart instead of a bar graph.

2.  (Numeracy) In the example, Company A's sales (5,200) are what percentage higher than Company B's sales (5,000)?

    **Answer:**

3.  What is meant by the term "cherry-picking data"?
    A) Selecting only the data that supports your argument.
    B) Making sure all data is from reliable sources.
    C) Using data specifically about fruit sales.
    D) Presenting all available data on a topic.

4.  (Critical Thinking) Explain in your own words what a "lurking variable" is, using the ice cream and drowning example.

5.  (Critical Thinking) Find an example of a graph online or in a newspaper. Does it show the Y-axis starting at 0? Do you think it presents the data fairly? Explain why or why not.
