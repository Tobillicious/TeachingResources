The handout includes exercises for deconstructing and applying these structures, fostering analytical and organizational skills in writing.

**Key Concepts Covered:**
*   Importance of structure in informational writing.
*   Definitions and examples of chronological order, compare and contrast, and cause and effect structures.
*   Identifying signal words for each structure.

## Why Does Structure Matter?

When you write to inform, your primary goal is **clarity**. You want your reader to understand the information easily and accurately. The way you structure your text is one of the most important tools for achieving this. A logical structure acts like a roadmap, guiding your reader through the information step-by-step. Choosing the right structure depends on your topic and what you want to explain. We will explore three common and effective structures for informational writing.

### Common Informational Text Structures

1.  **Chronological Order (Time Order)**
    Information is presented in the order that it happened. This is perfect for historical accounts, biographies, explaining a process, or recounting a sequence of events.

    **Signal words:** First, next, then, finally, before, after, on (date), during, in (year), since, until.

2.  **Compare and Contrast**
    This structure is used to explain the similarities and differences between two or more things. It's useful for reviews, analysis, and decision-making.

    **Signal words:** Similarly, likewise, on the other hand, however, both, in contrast, although, different from, same as, instead of.

3.  **Cause and Effect**
    This structure explains why something happened (the cause) and what happened as a result (the effect). It is ideal for scientific explanations, historical analysis, or explaining consequences.

    **Signal words:** Because, as a result, therefore, consequently, due to, led to, if...then, since, so, in order to.

### Deconstruction & Application

1.  **Deconstruction:** Read the short paragraphs below and identify which text structure is being used (Chronological, Compare/Contrast, or Cause/Effect).

    *"Due to a lack of rainfall, the region's reservoirs became dangerously low. Consequently, the local council was forced to implement strict water restrictions for all residents."

    **Structure:** ____________________

    *"The iPhone 15 features a USB-C port for charging. On the other hand, the iPhone 14 still used the older Lightning connector. Both models, however, have excellent camera systems."

    **Structure:** ____________________

2.  **Application:** Choose ONE of the topics below and write a short informational paragraph using the specified structure.

    *   Topic A: The main events of the 1981 Springbok Tour (**Chronological**)
    *   Topic B: The reasons for the decline in kiwi populations (**Cause and Effect**)
