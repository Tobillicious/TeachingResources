## Summary

This handout provides a reading comprehension text that examines the pervasive influence of Artificial Intelligence (AI) in modern society, particularly within Aotearoa New Zealand. It explores AI's diverse applications across various sectors, its potential benefits, and the critical ethical questions it raises, encouraging students to engage thoughtfully with this transformative technology.

**Key Concepts Covered:**
*   Definition and real-world applications of AI.
*   AI's impact on industries like agriculture and healthcare in NZ.
*   Ethical considerations: responsibility for AI errors, data bias, and representation.
*   AI's influence on the future of work and the need for digital literacy.

## Overview for Kaiako

**LEARNING AREA:** Digital Technologies (primary), Social Sciences (secondary)

**YEAR LEVEL:** Year 9-13

**CURRICULUM LINKS:** Supports Achievement Objectives related to understanding how digital systems work and their impact on society; exploring the ethical considerations of emerging technologies; analyzing and interpreting complex informational texts; understanding the implications of technology for the future of work (NZC Digital Technologies, Progress Outcome 4/5; Social Sciences, Level 5; Te Mataiaho: Te Ao Hangarau - Digital Technologies, Te Ao Tangata - Social Sciences).

**KEY COMPETENCIES:** Thinking (analyzing complex systems, ethical reasoning, problem-solving), Managing Self (developing informed opinions, engaging with complex ideas), Participating and Contributing (discussing societal impact, understanding diverse perspectives), Using Language, Symbols, and Texts (interpreting technical information, evaluating arguments).

**VALUES:** Whanaungatanga (understanding AI's impact on communities, fostering inclusive technological development), Manaakitanga (caring for people's well-being in an AI-driven world, addressing bias), Whaiora (fostering curiosity and innovation responsibly), Tūrangawaewae (connecting AI to local industries and cultural contexts, discussing data sovereignty for Māori/Pasifika).

**CULTURAL CONSIDERATIONS & ADAPTATIONS:** This handout can be used to spark discussions on how AI might impact Māori and Pasifika communities, including issues of data sovereignty, bias in algorithms, and the potential for AI to support or diminish cultural practices (e.g., Te Reo Māori language models). Encourage students to explore ethical frameworks from diverse cultural perspectives when discussing AI's benefits and challenges. Use examples of AI applications in New Zealand industries or research that are relevant to students' backgrounds.

## Reading Comprehension: The AI Revolution

### How AI is Changing Our World

Artificial Intelligence (AI), the simulation of human intelligence in machines, is no longer science fiction; it's a part of everyday life in Aotearoa. When you get a movie recommendation from Netflix or see a personalised ad on social media, you are interacting with an AI. These systems use complex algorithms to analyse vast amounts of data, identify patterns, and make predictions. In New Zealand, AI is being adopted across various sectors. In agriculture, for instance, AI-powered drones can monitor crop health and apply fertiliser with precision, reducing waste and environmental impact.

The potential of AI in healthcare is particularly significant. Researchers at the University of Otago are training AI models to detect early signs of skin cancer from images with an accuracy rate that could soon surpass human dermatologists. One model achieved a 95% accuracy rate in identifying malignant melanomas in a recent trial. This could lead to faster, more accessible diagnostics for people in remote areas. However, the use of AI also raises ethical questions. Who is responsible if an AI makes a mistake in a diagnosis? How do we ensure that the data used to train these systems is unbiased and representative of all New Zealanders, including Māori and Pasifika peoples?

As AI becomes more integrated into our society, the conversation about its impact on jobs is growing louder. While some roles may be automated, many experts believe AI will create new jobs that require different skills. The focus is shifting towards human-AI collaboration, where AI handles repetitive tasks, freeing up humans to concentrate on creativity, critical thinking, and complex problem-solving. The challenge for New Zealand's education system is to prepare students for this future, equipping them with the adaptability and digital literacy skills needed to thrive in an AI-driven world.

### Comprehension & Critical Thinking Questions

1.  According to the text, what is a real-world example of AI being used in New Zealand's agriculture sector?
    A) AI robots planting entire forests.
    B) AI predicting the weather with perfect accuracy.
    C) AI-powered drones monitoring crop health.
    D) AI translating conversations between farmers.

2.  (Numeracy) In the University of Otago trial, if the AI model analysed 200 images of melanomas, how many would it correctly identify based on its 95% accuracy rate?

    **Answer:**

3.  What is one of the main ethical questions raised about using AI in healthcare?
    A) Whether AI is becoming too expensive for hospitals.
    B) Who is responsible if an AI makes an incorrect diagnosis.
    C) Whether AI can work without an internet connection.
    D) Whether human doctors will still be needed for surgery.

4.  (Critical Thinking) The text suggests AI will handle "repetitive tasks" while humans focus on "creativity, critical thinking, and complex problem-solving." Provide one example of a repetitive task AI could do in a school, and one example of a creative task a student would still need to do.

5.  (Critical Thinking) The text mentions the need to ensure AI training data is "unbiased." Why is this important? What might happen if an AI used for hiring people was trained on biased data?
