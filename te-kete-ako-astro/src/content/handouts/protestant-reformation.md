## What was the Reformation?

The Protestant Reformation was a major 16th-century European movement aimed initially at reforming the beliefs and practices of the Roman Catholic Church. Its religious aspects were supplemented by ambitious political rulers who wanted to extend their power and control at the expense of the Church.

## Martin Luther and the 95 Theses

The Reformation is usually considered to have started with the publication of the **Ninety-five Theses** by **Martin Luther** in 1517. Luther was a German monk and theologian who was angered by the Church's practice of selling **indulgences** (a remission of the temporal punishment for sin). He argued that salvation could be reached through faith and by divine grace only.

## Key Ideas of the Reformation

-   **Sola Scriptura ("by Scripture alone"):** The belief that the Bible is the only source of religious authority.
-   **Sola Fide ("by faith alone"):** The belief that salvation is a gift of God's grace, received through faith alone, not through good works.
-   **The Priesthood of All Believers:** The idea that all believers have direct access to God and do not need to go through a priest.

## The Spread of Protestantism

Luther's ideas spread rapidly, thanks to the invention of the **printing press**. Other key figures in the Reformation include:
-   **John Calvin:** A French theologian who established a Protestant theocracy in Geneva, Switzerland. His ideas were very influential in the development of Presbyterianism.
-   **King Henry VIII of England:** Broke with the Catholic Church for political reasons, establishing the Church of England (the Anglican Church).

## The Counter-Reformation

The Catholic Church responded to the Protestant Reformation with its own **Counter-Reformation**. This involved a series of reforms and a renewed focus on spirituality and missionary work.

## Consequences

The Reformation had a profound impact on European society:
-   It led to a century of religious wars.
-   It permanently split the Christian church in Western Europe.
-   It contributed to the rise of nationalism and the modern nation-state.
