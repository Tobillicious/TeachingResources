## Summary

This handout serves as a guide to the Statistical Enquiry Cycle, a systematic process for conducting investigations using data. Students will learn about the stages of problem formulation, planning data collection, data organization, and analysis. It includes examples and a template for students to plan their own investigations, fostering statistical literacy, critical thinking, and an understanding of how data can inform decisions.

**Key Concepts Covered:**
*   The Statistical Enquiry Cycle (Problem, Plan, Data, Analysis).
*   Methods for data collection (surveys, observations, existing data).
*   Interpreting data from bar graphs.
*   Key statistical terms (mode, range, total, category).

## Overview for Kaiako

**LEARNING AREA:** Mathematics (Statistics)

**YEAR LEVEL:** Year 8-10 (adaptable for Year 7-13 with differentiated complexity)

**CURRICULUM LINKS:** Supports Achievement Objectives related to investigating and interpreting statistical information; planning and conducting statistical investigations; understanding how data can be used to make informed decisions (NZC Mathematics, Level 4/5; Te Mataiaho: Te Ao Tau - Mathematics, Te Ao Tangata - Social Sciences).

**KEY COMPETENCIES:** Thinking (formulating questions, analyzing data, drawing conclusions), Managing Self (organizing investigations, systematic approach), Participating and Contributing (collaborative data collection, discussing findings), Using Language, Symbols, and Texts (interpreting statistical diagrams, communicating statistical ideas).

**VALUES:** Whanaungatanga (collaborative data analysis, understanding community needs through data), Manaakitanga (using data responsibly, respecting privacy), Whaiora (using data to improve well-being, e.g., health data, sports performance), T≈´rangawaewae (analyzing data related to local school environment, cultural events, or community initiatives, discussing data sovereignty).

**CULTURAL CONSIDERATIONS & ADAPTATIONS:** Encourage students to choose investigation questions that are relevant to their own lives, whƒÅnau, or cultural groups within Mangakotukutuku College (e.g., favorite cultural foods, participation in cultural events, languages spoken at home); discuss the ethical implications of collecting and representing data about people from diverse backgrounds; explore how statistics are used in MƒÅori and Pasifika contexts (e.g., health statistics, population data); emphasize the importance of respectful data handling and interpretation.

## üìä The Statistical Enquiry Cycle

The Statistical Enquiry Cycle is a process used to investigate questions and make sense of data. It helps us to systematically gather, organize, and interpret information.

*   **1. Problem:** What question do you want to answer? This should be a clear, specific question that can be answered with data.
*   **2. Plan:** How will you collect your data? This involves deciding on your method, who you will collect data from, and how you will record it.
*   **3. Data:** Collect and organize your information. This is where you put your plan into action and record your findings.
*   **4. Analysis:** What patterns do you see? This involves looking at your organized data, calculating summaries (like totals or averages), and creating graphs to visualize it.
*   **5. Conclusion:** What can you say about your initial question based on your analysis? Did the data answer your question?

## üìã Data Collection Methods

*   **üéØ Surveys & Questionnaires:** Ask people questions to gather opinions, preferences, or facts. (e.g., "What is your favourite sport?")
*   **üëÄ Observations:** Watch and record what happens naturally. (e.g., Counting how many students bring reusable lunchboxes).
*   **üìä Existing Data:** Use information that's already been collected by others. (e.g., School attendance records, weather data).

## üîç Example: School Lunch Investigation

This example investigates the healthiness of school lunches. A bar chart (not displayed here, but imagine bars representing each category) shows the distribution of student lunches:

*   **Healthy:** 35 students
*   **Sometimes Healthy:** 42 students
*   **Unhealthy:** 23 students

1.  **What was the investigation question?** (e.g., "What is the healthiness distribution of lunches brought by Mangak≈çtukutuku College students?")

2.  **How was this data collected?** (e.g., By observing student lunches during lunchtime).

3.  **What conclusion can you draw?** (e.g., "The majority of students bring lunches that are sometimes healthy, indicating a need for more education on healthy eating.")

## ‚úèÔ∏è Plan Your Own Investigation

### Step 1: Choose Your Question

What do you want to find out about your school or community? (e.g., "What is the most popular extracurricular activity at Mangak≈çtukutuku College?")

### Step 2: Plan Your Data Collection

How will you gather your information?

*   [ ] Survey students
*   [ ] Count observations
*   [ ] Use school records

### Step 3: Design Your Data Table

Create a table to organize your data. For example:

| Category | Count |
| :------- | :---- |
| _________ | _____ |
| _________ | _____ |
| _________ | _____ |

## üìñ Key Statistical Terms

*   **Mode:** The value that appears most often in a set of data.
*   **Range:** The difference between the highest and lowest values in a set of data.
*   **Total:** The sum of all values in a set of data.
*   **Category:** A group of similar items or responses in your data.
