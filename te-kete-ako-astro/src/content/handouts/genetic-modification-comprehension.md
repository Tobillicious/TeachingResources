## Summary

This handout provides a reading comprehension text that delves into the complex world of genetic modification (GM) in Aotearoa New Zealand. It explores the scientific process of altering genetic makeup, its potential benefits in agriculture and conservation (e.g., methane reduction, pest control), and the significant ethical, cultural, and economic concerns raised by its use. Students will engage with critical thinking questions to analyze the multifaceted debate surrounding GM technology.

**Key Concepts Covered:**
*   Definition of genetic modification (GM/GE).
*   Potential benefits of GM in agriculture (e.g., ryegrass) and conservation (e.g., gene drives for pest control).
*   Concerns about unknown long-term effects on ecosystems and human health.
*   Māori cultural and spiritual concerns regarding whakapapa.
*   Impact on New Zealand's "clean, green" brand.

## Overview for Kaiako

**LEARNING AREA:** Science (Living World, Nature of Science), Social Sciences (Ethics, Economics)

**YEAR LEVEL:** Year 10-13

**CURRICULUM LINKS:** Supports Achievement Objectives related to understanding the biological world; exploring the ethical implications of scientific advancements; analyzing scientific information and societal responses; understanding diverse perspectives on scientific issues (NZC Science, Level 5; Social Sciences, Level 5; Te Mataiaho: Te Ao Tūroa - The Natural World, Te Ao Tangata - Social Sciences).

**KEY COMPETENCIES:** Thinking (analyzing scientific information, ethical reasoning, evaluating arguments), Managing Self (forming informed opinions on complex issues), Participating and Contributing (engaging in respectful debate, understanding diverse viewpoints), Using Language, Symbols, and Texts (interpreting scientific terminology, understanding persuasive language).

**VALUES:** Whanaungatanga (understanding diverse perspectives on GM, fostering respectful dialogue), Manaakitanga (caring for the environment and future generations, considering ethical implications for all living things), Whaiora (promoting responsible scientific innovation for well-being), Tūrangawaewae (connecting GM debates to New Zealand's unique biodiversity, agricultural practices, and Māori cultural values regarding whakapapa and land).

**CULTURAL CONSIDERATIONS & ADAPTATIONS:** Discuss the concept of whakapapa (genealogy, interconnectedness) from a Māori perspective and how genetic modification can be seen as interfering with this fundamental principle; explore traditional Māori practices of selective breeding or cultivation and compare them to modern GM; use examples of GM debates specific to New Zealand (e.g., GE trees, GE animals for conservation) to make the content relevant; ensure discussions are inclusive and respectful of all cultural and ethical viewpoints.

## Reading Comprehension: Genetic Modification

### The Contentious World of GE in Aotearoa

**Genetic modification (GM)**, also known as **genetic engineering (GE)**, is the process of altering the genetic makeup of an organism. In New Zealand, this technology is at the centre of a fierce debate, particularly concerning its use in primary industries like agriculture and conservation. Proponents, including many scientists and agricultural companies, argue that GM could unlock significant benefits. For example, researchers at AgResearch are developing genetically modified ryegrass that could reduce methane emissions from livestock by up to 23% and grow faster, potentially boosting farm productivity and helping New Zealand meet its climate change targets.

On the conservation front, GM is being explored as a tool for pest control. The "Predator Free 2050" initiative is investigating technologies like **gene drives**, which could spread a specific trait—such as infertility—through a pest population, causing it to collapse. This could offer a powerful alternative to traditional methods like traps and toxins for eradicating pests such as stoats, rats, and possums that devastate native wildlife. The potential to protect vulnerable species like the kiwi and kākāpō is a compelling argument for its use.

However, there is strong opposition to the use of GM technology in Aotearoa. Opponents raise concerns about the unknown long-term effects on ecosystems and human health. There are fears that genetically modified organisms could escape into the wild and interbreed with native species, with unpredictable consequences. From a Māori perspective, there are significant cultural and spiritual concerns regarding the modification of **whakapapa** (genealogy) of living things. Furthermore, New Zealand's "clean, green" brand is a vital part of its export identity, and many worry that embracing GM could damage this reputation and alienate international consumers. Currently, the use of GM is tightly restricted to research within secure labs, but the debate over releasing GM organisms into the environment continues to intensify.

### Comprehension & Critical Thinking Questions

1.  What is one potential benefit of genetically modified ryegrass mentioned in the text?
    A) It is resistant to all pests.
    B) It requires no water to grow.
    C) It can reduce methane emissions from livestock.
    D) It changes the colour of the animals that eat it.

2.  (Numeracy) If a farm's livestock produce 1,000 tonnes of methane annually, what is the maximum potential reduction in methane (in tonnes) if they switch to the new ryegrass?

    **Answer:**

3.  The text states that from a Māori perspective, there are concerns about modifying the "whakapapa" of living things. What is the best meaning of whakapapa in this context?
    A) The physical appearance of an organism.
    B) The genealogy and inherent identity of an organism.
    C) The economic value of an organism.
    D) The location where an organism is found.

4.  (Critical Thinking) Why might some people be concerned about using a "gene drive" for pest control, even if it is effective?

5.  (Critical Thinking) The text presents both potential benefits and risks of GM technology. Which argument do you find more persuasive, for or against its wider use in New Zealand? Justify your position using two different points from the text.
