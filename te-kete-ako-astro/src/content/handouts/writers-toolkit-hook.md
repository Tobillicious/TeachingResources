## What is a Hook?

A "**hook**" is the opening sentence or sentences of a piece of writing designed to grab the reader's attention and make them want to continue reading. It's your first chance to make a strong impression and pull your audience into your story or argument!

### Types of Hooks:

1.  **Question Hook:** Start with a thought-provoking question that makes the reader think or wonder.
    *   *Example:* "Have you ever considered how a single decision can change the course of your life?"

2.  **Anecdote Hook:** Begin with a short, personal story or a brief, interesting event that relates to your topic. This makes the writing feel more personal and relatable.
    *   *Example:* "The old wooden door creaked open, revealing a darkness that swallowed the light from my torch. I hesitated, remembering my grandmother's warning about the old whare at the edge of the bush."

3.  **Startling Fact/Statistic Hook:** Present a surprising or shocking piece of information or data. This immediately captures attention and establishes credibility.
    *   *Example:* "Every minute, 2.5 million emails are sent around the world, but how many of them truly capture our attention?"

4.  **Vivid Description Hook:** Paint a picture with words to set the scene, introduce a character, or create a mood. Use strong sensory details (sight, sound, smell, touch, taste).
    *   *Example:* "The ancient pōhutukawa tree stood sentinel over the Melville coastline, its gnarled branches, heavy with crimson blossoms, reaching like arthritic fingers towards the misty morning sky."

5.  **Quote Hook:** Start with a relevant and impactful quote from a famous person, a book, a song, or a proverb. Ensure the quote directly relates to your topic.
    *   *Example:* As the Māori proverb states, "He waka eke noa" (A canoe which we are all in without exception). This idea of collective responsibility is central to our discussion today.

### Practice:

Choose a topic (e.g., "The importance of protecting our local awa/river," "My favourite school event," "A day in the life of a kiwi bird," "The challenges of growing up in a diverse community") and write three different types of hooks for it. Aim to make each hook as engaging as possible.
