## Definitions

Figurative language uses words or expressions with a meaning that is different from the literal interpretation. It adds colour, depth, and imagination to writing, making it more engaging and memorable.

*   **Simile**
    A comparison between two different things using the words **'like'** or **'as'**. It helps the reader understand something unfamiliar by relating it to something familiar.
    *Example:* "The lake was as smooth as glass." (The lake is *like* glass in its smoothness).

*   **Metaphor**
    A direct comparison where one thing is said to **be** another. It doesn't use 'like' or 'as'. Metaphors create a stronger, more direct image.
    *Example:* "The classroom was a zoo." (The classroom *is* a zoo, implying chaos and noise).

*   **Personification**
    Giving human qualities, characteristics, or actions to inanimate objects, animals, or abstract ideas.
    *Example:* "The wind whispered through the trees." (Wind cannot literally whisper, but it sounds like it).

*   **Onomatopoeia**
    A word that imitates the sound it represents. These words bring sounds to life in writing.
    *Example:* "The bacon *sizzled* in the pan." (*Sizzle* sounds like the action).

*   **Alliteration**
    The repetition of the same sound (usually a consonant sound) at the beginning of words that are close together in a phrase or sentence. It creates a musical effect and can draw attention to certain words.
    *Example:* "**S**he **s**ells **s**eashells by the **s**eashore." (Repetition of the 's' sound).

*   **Hyperbole**
    An extreme exaggeration used for emphasis or effect. It's not meant to be taken literally.
    *Example:* "I've told you a million times!" (The speaker hasn't literally told you a million times, but they want to emphasize their frustration).
