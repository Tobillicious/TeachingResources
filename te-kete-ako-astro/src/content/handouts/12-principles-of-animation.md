The 12 principles of animation are a set of guidelines for creating more realistic and appealing animation. They were developed by Disney animators Frank Thomas and Ollie Johnston in the 1930s.

1.  **Squash and Stretch:** Gives a sense of weight and flexibility to drawn objects.
2.  **Anticipation:** Prepares the audience for an action.
3.  **Staging:** The presentation of an idea so that it is clear.
4.  **Straight Ahead Action and Pose to Pose:** Two different approaches to the drawing process. "Straight ahead" is where you draw frame-by-frame from start to finish. "Pose to pose" is where you draw the key poses first and then fill in the in-between frames.
5.  **Follow Through and Overlapping Action:** The idea that different parts of a body or object will continue to move after the main body has stopped.
6.  **Slow In and Slow Out:** The idea that objects need time to accelerate and slow down.
7.  **Arcs:** Most natural movements follow an arched trajectory.
8.  **Secondary Action:** Gestures that support the main action to add more dimension to the character.
9.  **Timing:** The number of frames for a given action, which translates to the speed of the action on film.
10. **Exaggeration:** Pushing movements further to increase their impact, without distorting them completely.
11. **Solid Drawing:** Taking into account forms in three-dimensional space, giving them volume and weight.
12. **Appeal:** The quality of being pleasing to the eye. This applies to every character, whether a hero or a villain.
