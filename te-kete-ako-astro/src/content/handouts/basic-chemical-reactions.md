## What is a Chemical Reaction?

A chemical reaction is a process that leads to the chemical transformation of one set of chemical substances to another.

**Reactants → Products**

## 1. Synthesis Reaction

Two or more simple substances combine to form a more complex product.

**General Formula:** `A + B → AB`

**Example:** The formation of water from hydrogen and oxygen.
`2H₂ + O₂ → 2H₂O`

## 2. Decomposition Reaction

A complex molecule breaks down to make simpler ones.

**General Formula:** `AB → A + B`

**Example:** The breakdown of hydrogen peroxide into water and oxygen.
`2H₂O₂ → 2H₂O + O₂`

## 3. Single Displacement Reaction

Also known as a single replacement reaction, this is when one element is replaced by another in a compound.

**General Formula:** `A + BC → AC + B`

**Example:** Zinc reacting with hydrochloric acid.
`Zn + 2HCl → ZnCl₂ + H₂`

## 4. Double Displacement Reaction

Also known as a double replacement reaction, this is when the positive and negative ions of two ionic compounds exchange places to form two new compounds.

**General Formula:** `AB + CD → AD + CB`

**Example:** The reaction between lead(II) nitrate and potassium iodide.
`Pb(NO₃)₂ + 2KI → PbI₂ + 2KNO₃`
