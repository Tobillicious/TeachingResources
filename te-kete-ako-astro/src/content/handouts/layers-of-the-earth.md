## A Journey to the Center of the Earth

Our planet is like an onion, made up of several distinct layers.

*(A cross-section diagram of the Earth would be included here in a full resource)*

### 1. The Crust
-   **What it is:** The Earth's thin, rocky outer layer. It's the part we live on.
-   **Thickness:** Varies from about 5 km thick under the oceans to about 70 km thick on the continents.
-   **State:** Solid rock.

### 2. The Mantle
-   **What it is:** The thickest layer of the Earth, making up about 84% of its volume.
-   **Composition:** Made of hot, dense, semi-solid rock that flows like a very thick liquid over millions of years. This movement is what drives plate tectonics.
-   **State:** Semi-solid (plastic).

### 3. The Outer Core
-   **What it is:** A layer of molten metal surrounding the inner core.
-   **Composition:** Made of liquid iron and nickel.
-   **State:** Liquid.
-   **Key Feature:** The movement of the liquid metal in the outer core generates the Earth's magnetic field.

### 4. The Inner Core
-   **What it is:** The very center of the Earth.
-   **Composition:** A solid ball of iron and nickel.
-   **State:** Solid.
-   **Why is it solid?** Even though it is incredibly hot (as hot as the surface of the sun), the immense pressure from the layers above forces it to be solid.
