## Anatomy of the Human Eye

The human eye is a complex organ that works like a camera to capture light and send information to the brain.

*(A simple diagram of the eye would be included here in a full resource)*

### Key Parts and Their Functions

1.  **Cornea:** The transparent, dome-shaped outer layer at the very front of the eye. It protects the eye and helps to focus light.
2.  **Pupil:** The black dot in the center of the eye. It is an opening that allows light to enter.
3.  **Iris:** The colored part of the eye. It is a muscle that controls the size of the pupil, regulating the amount of light that enters.
4.  **Lens:** Located behind the pupil, the lens is a clear, flexible structure that focuses light onto the retina. It can change its shape to focus on objects at different distances.
5.  **Retina:** The light-sensitive layer at the back of the eye. It contains millions of photoreceptor cells called **rods** (for low light and black and white vision) and **cones** (for bright light and color vision).
6.  **Optic Nerve:** A bundle of more than a million nerve fibers that transmits visual information from the retina to the brain.
