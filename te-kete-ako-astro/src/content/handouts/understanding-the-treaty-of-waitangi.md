## What is the Treaty of Waitangi?

The Treaty of Waitangi (Te Tiriti o Waitangi) is a founding document of New Zealand. It was signed on February 6, 1840, at Waitangi, in the Bay of Islands, by representatives of the British Crown and various Māori chiefs (rangatira).

### Two Versions, Different Meanings:

Crucially, there are two versions of the Treaty: an English version and a Māori version. These versions differ significantly in their meaning, leading to ongoing debate and interpretation.

*   **English Version:** Generally understood to grant the British Crown sovereignty over New Zealand, while guaranteeing Māori possession of their lands, forests, fisheries, and other properties, and giving them the rights of British subjects.
*   **Māori Version (Te Tiriti o Waitangi):** Generally understood to grant the Crown `kāwanatanga` (governorship or governance) over the land, while guaranteeing `tino rangatiratanga` (full chieftainship, sovereignty, or authority) to Māori over their lands, villages, and all their treasures (`taonga`). It also gave Māori the same rights as the people of England.

### Key Principles of the Treaty:

Over time, the courts and the Waitangi Tribunal have developed a set of principles to guide the interpretation and application of the Treaty, aiming to reconcile the differences between the two texts. These commonly include:

1.  **Partnership:** The Crown and Māori are partners in New Zealand, requiring good faith and reasonable action from both sides.
2.  **Protection:** The Crown has a responsibility to actively protect Māori interests, including their language, culture, and resources.
3.  **Participation:** Māori have the right to participate in all levels of government and decision-making processes.
4.  **Equity:** The Crown is obliged to ensure equitable outcomes for Māori.
5.  **Redress:** Where breaches of the Treaty have occurred, the Crown has a responsibility to provide redress (e.g., apologies, financial compensation, return of land).

### Significance and Impact:

The Treaty of Waitangi is central to New Zealand's identity and legal framework. Its ongoing significance includes:

*   **Basis for Law:** It is recognized in various pieces of legislation and court decisions.
*   **Waitangi Tribunal:** Established in 1975, the Tribunal investigates claims by Māori against the Crown for breaches of the Treaty.
*   **Māori Rights and Culture:** It underpins the recognition and protection of Māori rights, language (Te Reo Māori), and culture.
*   **National Identity:** It shapes discussions about biculturalism and the relationship between Māori and non-Māori in New Zealand.
