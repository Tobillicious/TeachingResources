## What is Financial Literacy?

**Financial literacy** is the ability to understand and effectively use various financial skills, including personal financial management, budgeting, and investing. It's about making informed decisions with your money to achieve your goals and build a secure future.

### Key Concepts:

1.  **Income:** Money you earn from work (e.g., part-time job), investments, or other sources (e.g., allowance, benefits). Understanding your income is the first step to managing your money.
2.  **Expenses:** Money you spend. These can be divided into:
    *   **Needs:** Essential things you must pay for (e.g., food, housing, transportation, school supplies).
    *   **Wants:** Non-essential things you desire (e.g., entertainment, new clothes, eating out).
    Tracking expenses helps you see where your money goes.
3.  **Budgeting:** Creating a plan for how you will spend and save your money. A budget helps you prioritize your spending, ensure you don't spend more than you earn, and work towards your financial goals.
    *   **50/30/20 Rule:** A popular budgeting guideline where:
        *   **50%** of your income goes to **Needs**.
        *   **30%** of your income goes to **Wants**.
        *   **20%** of your income goes to **Savings & Debt Repayment**.
4.  **Saving:** Setting aside money for future goals. It's important to save regularly, even small amounts, to build financial security.
    *   **Emergency Fund:** A crucial type of saving, typically 3-6 months of living expenses, kept for unexpected events like job loss, medical emergencies, or car repairs. This provides a financial safety net.
5.  **Debt:** Money owed to others. Understanding different types of debt (e.g., credit card debt, student loans, mortgages) and how to manage them responsibly is vital to avoid financial stress.
6.  **Investing:** Putting money into assets (like stocks, bonds, property, or KiwiSaver) with the expectation of earning a return over time. Investing can help your money grow faster than just saving, but it also involves risk.

### Why is Financial Literacy Important?

Being financially literate empowers you to make smart financial choices, achieve your financial goals (like buying a car, going to university, or owning a home), and build a secure future. It reduces stress related to money and provides a sense of control over your life, allowing you to pursue your aspirations.
