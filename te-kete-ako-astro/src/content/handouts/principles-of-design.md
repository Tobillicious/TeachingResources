## What are the Principles of Design?

If the Elements of Art are the ingredients, the Principles of Design are the recipe. They are the rules and guidelines artists use to organize the elements and create an effective composition.

### 1. Balance
The distribution of the visual weight of objects, colors, texture, and space.
-   **Symmetrical Balance:** The elements on one side of the design are similar to those on the other side.
-   **Asymmetrical Balance:** The sides are different but still look balanced.
-   **Radial Balance:** The elements are arranged around a central point.

### 2. Contrast
The arrangement of opposite elements (light vs. dark colors, rough vs. smooth textures) to create visual interest.

### 3. Emphasis (or Focal Point)
The part of the design that catches the viewer's attention. The artist will make one area stand out by contrasting it with other areas.

### 4. Movement
The path the viewer's eye takes through the work of art, often to focal areas. Such movement can be directed along lines, edges, shape, and color within the work.

### 5. Pattern
The repeating of an object or symbol all over the work of art.

### 6. Rhythm
Created when one or more elements of design are used repeatedly to create a feeling of organized movement. Rhythm creates a mood like music or dancing.

### 7. Unity / Harmony
The feeling of harmony between all parts of the work of art, which creates a sense of completeness.
