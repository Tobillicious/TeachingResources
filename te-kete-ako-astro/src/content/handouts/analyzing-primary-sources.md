## What is a Primary Source?

A primary source is a first-hand account or an artifact created during the time period you are studying. Examples include letters, diaries, photographs, speeches, government documents, and newspaper articles.

## The 5 Ws of Analysis

When you encounter a primary source, use these five questions to guide your analysis.

### 1. Who?
-   **Who created this source?**
-   What was their position or perspective? (e.g., a soldier, a politician, a civilian)
-   Who was the intended audience? (e.g., a private diary entry, a public speech)

### 2. What?
-   **What is the source?** (e.g., a letter, a political cartoon, a photograph)
-   **What is its main message or argument?**
-   What information or evidence does it provide?

### 3. When?
-   **When was this source created?**
-   How does the date affect its meaning? What was happening at the time?
-   Is it a memory recorded long after the event, or an immediate reaction?

### 4. Where?
-   **Where was this source created?**
-   How does the location influence the content? (e.g., a letter from the trenches vs. a speech in parliament)

### 5. Why?
-   **Why was this source created?** This is the most important question.
-   What was the author's purpose? (e.g., to persuade, to inform, to record an event, to express a feeling)
-   Does the author have a bias? (Everyone does! What is it?)

## Putting It All Together

Once you have answered the 5 Ws, you can form a conclusion about the source's usefulness and reliability. How does this source help you understand the historical event or time period? What does it *not* tell you?
