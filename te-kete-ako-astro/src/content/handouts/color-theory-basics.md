## The Color Wheel

The color wheel is a visual tool that helps us understand the relationships between colors.

### Primary Colors
These are the three fundamental colors that cannot be made by mixing other colors together.
- **Red**
- **Yellow**
- **Blue**

### Secondary Colors
These are created by mixing two primary colors.
- **Orange** (Red + Yellow)
- **Green** (Yellow + Blue)
- **Violet** (Blue + Red)

### Tertiary Colors
These are created by mixing a primary color with a secondary color next to it on the color wheel.
- Red-Orange
- Yellow-Orange
- Yellow-Green
- Blue-Green
- Blue-Violet
- Red-Violet

## Color Harmonies

Color harmonies are combinations of colors that are considered pleasing to the eye.

### Complementary Colors
Colors that are directly opposite each other on the color wheel (e.g., **Red and Green**). They create high contrast.

### Analogous Colors
Colors that are next to each other on the color wheel (e.g., **Red, Red-Orange, and Orange**). They create a sense of unity and calm.

### Triadic Colors
Three colors that are evenly spaced around the color wheel (e.g., **Red, Yellow, and Blue**). They create a vibrant, balanced look.

## Warm vs. Cool Colors

- **Warm Colors:** Reds, Oranges, Yellows. They tend to feel energetic and advance in space.
- **Cool Colors:** Blues, Greens, Violets. They tend to feel calm and recede in space.
