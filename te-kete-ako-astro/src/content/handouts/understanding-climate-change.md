## Summary

This handout provides a foundational understanding of climate change, explaining its primary causes (human activities, greenhouse gas emissions), widespread effects (rising temperatures, sea levels, extreme weather), and potential solutions (renewable energy, sustainable practices, international cooperation). It aims to foster environmental literacy and encourage critical thinking about this global challenge and its local implications.

**Key Concepts Covered:**
*   Definition of climate change and its human drivers.
*   Causes: greenhouse gas emissions (fossil fuels, deforestation, agriculture).
*   Effects: rising temperatures, melting ice, sea level rise, extreme weather, ocean acidification, ecosystem impacts.
*   Solutions: renewable energy, energy efficiency, sustainable land use, afforestation, carbon capture, international cooperation.

## Overview for Kaiako

**LEARNING AREA:** Science (Planet Earth and Beyond, Living World), Social Sciences (Environment, Citizenship)

**YEAR LEVEL:** Year 9-13

**CURRICULUM LINKS:** Supports Achievement Objectives related to understanding Earth's processes and systems; exploring human impact on the environment; understanding concepts of sustainability and global interconnectedness; analyzing scientific information and societal responses (NZC Science, Level 4/5; Social Sciences, Level 5; Te Mataiaho: Te Ao Tūroa - The Natural World, Te Ao Tangata - Social Sciences).

**KEY COMPETENCIES:** Thinking (analyzing complex environmental problems, evaluating solutions, critical reasoning), Managing Self (considering personal environmental footprint, responsible consumption), Participating and Contributing (engaging in discussions about climate action, understanding collective responsibility), Using Language, Symbols, and Texts (interpreting scientific data, understanding environmental reports).

**VALUES:** Whanaungatanga (collective responsibility for environmental well-being, understanding global impacts), Manaakitanga (caring for the environment and future generations), Whaiora (promoting a healthy planet for all), Tūrangawaewae (connecting climate change impacts to local environments in Aotearoa, discussing Māori perspectives on kaitiakitanga and the interconnectedness of land, sea, and people).

**CULTURAL CONSIDERATIONS & ADAPTATIONS:** Discuss Māori concepts of kaitiakitanga (guardianship) in relation to the environment and climate change; explore how climate change disproportionately affects Pacific Island nations and coastal Māori communities; use examples of climate change impacts and adaptation strategies specific to New Zealand (e.g., sea-level rise in coastal areas, changes in agricultural patterns); encourage students to consider indigenous knowledge and practices in addressing environmental challenges; ensure discussions are inclusive and respectful of all viewpoints.

## What is Climate Change?

**Climate change** refers to long-term shifts in temperatures and weather patterns. While these shifts can be natural, since the 1800s, human activities have been the main driver of climate change, primarily due to the burning of fossil fuels (like coal, oil, and gas), which produces heat-trapping gases.

### Causes of Climate Change:

1.  **Greenhouse Gas Emissions:** The primary cause is the increase in **greenhouse gases** (like carbon dioxide (CO₂), methane, and nitrous oxide) in the atmosphere. These gases trap heat, leading to a warming effect on the planet.
    *   **Fossil Fuels:** Burning coal, oil, and natural gas for electricity, heat, and transportation is the largest source of these emissions.
    *   **Deforestation:** Forests absorb CO₂ from the atmosphere. When they are cut down or burned, that CO₂ is released, and there are fewer trees to absorb future emissions.
    *   **Agriculture:** Livestock farming (producing methane) and certain fertilizers (producing nitrous oxide) are significant sources of greenhouse gases.

### Effects of Climate Change:

The impacts of climate change are widespread and significant, affecting every part of the world:

1.  **Rising Global Temperatures:** Leading to more frequent and intense heatwaves, impacting human health and ecosystems.
2.  **Melting Glaciers and Ice Sheets:** Large ice formations are melting at an accelerated rate, contributing to rising sea levels.
3.  **Rising Sea Levels:** Threatening coastal communities, low-lying islands (including many Pacific Island nations), and ecosystems through increased flooding and erosion.
4.  **More Extreme Weather Events:** Including more intense storms, prolonged droughts, severe floods, and devastating wildfires.
5.  **Ocean Acidification:** Oceans absorb excess CO₂ from the atmosphere, becoming more acidic. This harms marine life, particularly shellfish and coral reefs.
6.  **Impacts on Ecosystems and Biodiversity:** Shifting habitats, increased risk of species extinction, and disruption of natural cycles.

### Solutions to Climate Change:

Addressing climate change requires a global effort and a combination of strategies:

1.  **Transition to Renewable Energy:** Shifting from fossil fuels to clean, renewable sources like solar, wind, hydro, and geothermal power.
2.  **Energy Efficiency:** Reducing energy consumption in homes, transportation, and industry through better design and technology.
3.  **Sustainable Agriculture and Land Use:** Promoting farming practices that reduce emissions and enhance carbon sequestration (e.g., planting trees, healthy soil management).
4.  **Afforestation and Reforestation:** Planting new trees and restoring degraded forests to absorb more CO₂.
5.  **Carbon Capture Technologies:** Developing technologies to capture CO₂ from industrial sources or directly from the atmosphere.
6.  **International Cooperation:** Governments, businesses, communities, and individuals working together to implement policies and solutions on a global scale.
