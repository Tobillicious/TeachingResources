## Project Overview

In this project, students will become historians, scientists, and storytellers. They will conduct research on the Mangakōtukutuku stream, learning about its original path, its ecological health, and its importance to local iwi. The final product will be a multimedia presentation to share their findings with the school and wider community.

## Key Learning Goals

- **Understand Kaitiakitanga:** Develop a deep understanding of the concept of guardianship and its practical application.
- **Scientific Investigation:** Conduct water quality tests, identify native and invasive species, and analyze the stream's ecosystem.
- **Historical Research:** Use primary and secondary sources to uncover the history of the awa, including pre-colonial times.
- **Digital Storytelling:** Create a compelling narrative using video, audio, and visual aids to communicate their findings.

## Phases of the Project

### Phase 1: Tūhura (Exploration & Discovery) - (Weeks 1-2)
- **Activities:** Field trips to different points along the stream, guest speakers from local iwi and the council, initial library and online research.
- **Guiding Questions:** What is the current state of our awa? What was it like in the past?

### Phase 2: Rangahau (Research & Investigation) - (Weeks 3-4)
- **Activities:** In-depth group research on specific topics (e.g., water quality, oral histories, historical maps). Students will form expert groups.
- **Guiding Questions:** What are the key challenges facing the awa? What stories are not being told?

### Phase 3: Whakaatu (Creation & Presentation) - (Weeks 5-6)
- **Activities:** Storyboarding, filming, editing, and rehearsing the final presentation.
- **Guiding Questions:** What is the most effective way to share this story? How can we inspire others to become kaitiaki?

## Assessment

Assessment will be based on:
- Research portfolios (notes, data, sources).
- Group collaboration and participation.
- The quality and impact of the final multimedia presentation.
