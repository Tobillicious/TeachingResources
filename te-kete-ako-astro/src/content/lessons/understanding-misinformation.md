## Overview

**LEARNING AREA:** Social Sciences (primary), Digital Technologies, English (secondary)

**YEAR LEVEL:** Year 9-13

**ACHIEVEMENT OBJECTIVES/TE MATAIAHO LINKS:** Students will understand how individuals and groups interact in society; analyze how information is communicated and interpreted; develop critical thinking skills to evaluate sources and perspectives; understand the ethical implications of digital communication (NZC Social Sciences, Level 4/5; Digital Technologies, Progress Outcome 4/5; Te Mataiaho: Te Ao Tangata - Social Sciences, Te Ao Hangarau - Digital Technologies).

**KEY COMPETENCIES:** Thinking (critically evaluating information, analyzing bias, forming reasoned judgments), Managing Self (responsible online behaviour, seeking reliable information), Participating and Contributing (engaging in respectful debate, promoting media literacy in their community), Using Language, Symbols, and Texts (interpreting media messages, understanding persuasive techniques).

**VALUES:** Whanaungatanga (fostering respectful dialogue, understanding how misinformation can divide communities), Manaakitanga (caring for others by sharing accurate information, protecting vulnerable individuals from online harm), Whaiora (promoting mental well-being by reducing anxiety from misinformation), T큰rangawaewae (understanding how misinformation can impact local narratives, history, and cultural identity, particularly for M훮ori and Pasifika communities).

**DURATION:** 75 minutes fixed.

**CULTURAL CONSIDERATIONS & ADAPTATIONS:** Discuss historical and contemporary examples of misinformation that have impacted M훮ori and Pasifika communities in Aotearoa (e.g., land claims, health narratives); explore how cultural biases can influence the spread and interpretation of information; encourage students to critically evaluate information from diverse cultural sources and perspectives; emphasize the importance of verifying information before sharing, especially within wh훮nau and community networks.

## Core Lesson Components

**DO NOW ACTIVITY:** Display a few sensational or questionable headlines (without revealing their truthfulness). Ask students: "Would you share this? Why or why not? What makes you trust or distrust a headline?" Discuss their initial reactions. (10 minutes)

**LEARNING INTENTION:** To define misinformation and disinformation, identify common characteristics of misinformation, apply critical thinking skills to evaluate information sources, and understand the impact of misinformation on individuals and society.

**SUCCESS CRITERIA:** I can define misinformation and disinformation, list at least three characteristics of misinformation, use a checklist to evaluate an information source, and explain one real-world impact of misinformation.

**EXIT TICKET:** Students write one strategy they will use to spot misinformation online and one piece of information they will always verify before sharing. (5 minutes)

## Instructions to Teach

Facilitate a critical inquiry into misinformation by defining its forms and characteristics, guiding students through practical exercises in source evaluation, and fostering a nuanced discussion on its societal impact, empowering them to become discerning and responsible digital citizens.

## Lesson Content

### 1. Introduction: Navigating the Information Landscape

In today's digital world, we are constantly bombarded with information from social media, news websites, friends, and family. It's more important than ever to be able to tell the difference between what's true and what's false.

*   **Misinformation:** Information that is false, but not intended to cause harm. It's often shared by accident or due to a misunderstanding.
*   **Disinformation:** Information that is deliberately false and created to deceive or mislead people, often for political or financial gain.

### 2. Characteristics of Misinformation

Misinformation often has certain tell-tale signs. When you see these, it's a signal to be skeptical:

*   **Sensational Headlines/Clickbait:** Designed to shock or provoke, often using extreme language to get you to click.
*   **Lack of Credible Sources or Evidence:** No mention of where the information came from, or it cites unreliable sources.
*   **Emotional Language:** Uses strong emotions (anger, fear, excitement) to bypass your critical thinking.
*   **Poor Grammar or Spelling:** Professional news sources usually have high editorial standards.
*   **Outdated Information Presented as Current:** Old news or statistics presented as if they are happening now.
*   **Appeals to Conspiracy Theories:** Suggests secret plots or hidden truths without solid evidence.
*   **Manipulated Images or Videos:** Photos or videos that have been altered or taken out of context.

**Activity:** Provide students with a few examples of headlines or short articles (some real, some fabricated/misleading). In small groups, have them identify which characteristics of misinformation are present.

### 3. Evaluating Information Sources

To combat misinformation, we need to be critical consumers of information. Use a checklist to evaluate sources:

*   **C** - **Context:** What is the purpose of this information? Who created it? When was it published?
*   **R** - **Reliability:** Is the source trustworthy? Is it known for accuracy? (e.g., established news organizations vs. anonymous blogs).
*   **A** - **Authority:** Who is the author? Are they an expert on the topic? What are their credentials?
*   **P** - **Purpose/Point of View:** Is there a bias? Is the author trying to persuade, inform, or entertain? Is it an opinion piece or a factual report?
*   **T** - **Timeliness:** Is the information up-to-date? Is it still relevant?

**Activity:** Distribute a "Spotting Misinformation Checklist" handout. In small groups, have students use the checklist to evaluate a few provided online articles or social media posts, discussing their findings.

### 4. Impact of Misinformation

Misinformation has serious real-world consequences:

*   **Impact on Health Decisions:** False information about health can lead to dangerous choices (e.g., vaccine misinformation).
*   **Influence on Political Processes:** Misleading information can sway public opinion and affect elections.
*   **Erosion of Trust:** When people can't tell what's true, it erodes trust in institutions, media, and even each other.
*   **Spread of Fear and Division:** Misinformation often plays on fears and can deepen divisions within communities.
*   **Harm to Individuals:** Cyberbullying, scams, and privacy breaches can cause significant personal distress.

### 5. Conclusion & Call to Action

Being able to identify and critically evaluate information is a vital skill for all digital citizens. You have the power to stop the spread of misinformation by being informed, thinking critically, and verifying information before you share it.
