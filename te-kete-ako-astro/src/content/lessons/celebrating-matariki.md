## He Kupu Whakataki (Introduction)

Matariki is the Māori name for the star cluster also known as the Pleiades. Its rising in the winter sky (Pipiri/June-Hōngongoi/July) marks the beginning of the Māori New Year. It is a time for remembrance, celebrating the present, and looking to the future.

## Ngā Whetū o Matariki (The Stars of Matariki)

The Matariki cluster contains hundreds of stars, but nine are prominently visible to the naked eye. Each star has a special significance:

- **Matariki**: The mother of the other stars in the cluster. A symbol of hope and connection to the environment.
- **Pōhutukawa**: Connects us to those who have passed away.
- **Tupuānuku**: Connected to food that grows in the ground.
- **Tupuārangi**: Connected to food that comes from the sky (birds and berries).
- **Waitī**: Connected to fresh water and the food within it.
- **Waitā**: Connected to the ocean and the food within it.
- **Waipuna-ā-rangi**: Connected to the rain.
- **Ururangi**: Connected to the winds.
- **Hiwa-i-te-rangi**: The star of your wishes and aspirations for the year ahead.
