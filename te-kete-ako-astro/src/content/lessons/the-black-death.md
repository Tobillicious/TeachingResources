## What was the Black Death?

The Black Death was a bubonic plague pandemic that occurred in Afro-Eurasia from 1346 to 1353. It is the most fatal pandemic recorded in human history, causing the death of 75â€“200 million people in Eurasia and North Africa, peaking in Europe from 1347 to 1351.

## How did it Spread?

The plague was caused by the bacterium *Yersinia pestis*. It was spread by fleas that were carried by rats on merchant ships. The disease likely originated in Central Asia and spread along the Silk Road, reaching the Crimea by 1347. From there, it was carried by Genoese traders to the Mediterranean and throughout Europe.

## Symptoms and Impact

The plague had a devastating impact on the population. The most common symptom was the appearance of **buboes** (swollen lymph nodes) in the groin, neck, and armpits, which oozed pus and bled when opened. The disease was swift and deadly, with a mortality rate of 30-60%.

## Social and Economic Consequences

The Black Death had a profound impact on European society:
-   **Labor Shortages:** With so many people dead, there was a severe shortage of labor. This meant that peasants could demand higher wages and better working conditions.
-   **Decline of Feudalism:** The labor shortage weakened the traditional feudal system, which was based on the labor of serfs tied to the land.
-   **Religious Upheaval:** The plague led to a crisis of faith for many people, who could not understand why God would allow such a terrible disaster to happen. This contributed to the questioning of the authority of the Catholic Church.
-   **Persecution:** In their fear and ignorance, people looked for scapegoats. Jewish communities were often blamed for the plague and were subjected to violent pogroms.
