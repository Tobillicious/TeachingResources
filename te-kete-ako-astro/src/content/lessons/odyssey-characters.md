## Introduction

Homer's *The Odyssey* is an epic poem filled with unforgettable characters. Understanding who they are and what motivates them is key to appreciating the story.

## The Hero's Household

-   **Odysseus:** The hero of the story. He is the king of Ithaca, a brilliant strategist, and a cunning warrior. His ten-year journey home from the Trojan War is the subject of the epic.
-   **Penelope:** Odysseus's wife and a symbol of marital fidelity. She cleverly holds off a horde of suitors who want to marry her and take Odysseus's throne.
-   **Telemachus:** Odysseus's son, who was just an infant when his father left for Troy. The first four books of the epic focus on his journey to find news of his father.

## The Gods: Helpers and Hindrances

-   **Athena:** The goddess of wisdom and warfare. She is Odysseus's patron goddess and helps him throughout his journey.
-   **Poseidon:** The god of the sea. He is Odysseus's main antagonist among the gods, seeking revenge on him for blinding his son, the Cyclops Polyphemus.

## Monsters and Magic

-   **Circe:** A powerful enchantress who turns many of Odysseus's crew into swine. Odysseus, with Athena's help, resists her magic and becomes her lover for a year.
-   **The Cyclops (Polyphemus):** A one-eyed giant who imprisons Odysseus and his crew, hoping to eat them. Odysseus outsmarts him, but his pride in revealing his true name brings Poseidon's wrath upon him.
