## Instructions to Teach

## Lesson Content

### 1. The Power of Storytelling

Storytelling is a fundamental part of all human cultures. For Māori and Pasifika peoples, oral traditions (stories passed down by word of mouth) were, and still are, incredibly important. These stories are not just for entertainment; they are powerful vehicles for transmitting knowledge, values, history, and identity across generations.

### 2. Māori Pūrākau

**Pūrākau** are traditional Māori narratives, often translated as myths, legends, or historical accounts. They explain the origins of the world, natural phenomena, the actions of gods and ancestors, and the establishment of tribal lands and customs.

**Characteristics of Pūrākau:**
*   **Oral Tradition:** Primarily passed down verbally, often through generations of skilled storytellers.
*   **Cultural Significance:** Deeply embedded with Māori values, beliefs, and worldview.
*   **Didactic Purpose:** Often teach lessons about morality, tikanga (customs), or the natural world.
*   **Connection to Land:** Many Pūrākau explain the formation of landscapes and connect people to their ancestral lands.
*   **Figurative Language:** Rich in metaphor, simile, and personification.

*Example: The stories of Māui, the demigod, who fished up Te Ika-a-Māui (the North Island) or snared the sun.*

### 3. Pasifika Narratives (e.g., Fāgogo, Tala)

Across the Pacific, diverse island nations have their own rich storytelling traditions. For example, in Samoa, **fāgogo** are traditional stories, often performed with song and dance. In Tonga, **tala** are narratives that can include myths, legends, and historical accounts.

**Common Themes in Pasifika Narratives:**
*   **Creation Myths:** Explaining the origins of islands, people, and the cosmos.
*   **Migration Stories:** Accounts of ancestral journeys across the ocean, often involving incredible feats of navigation.
*   **Heroic Figures:** Stories of brave chiefs, warriors, or tricksters.
*   **Connection to the Ocean:** The ocean is often a central character or setting, reflecting its vital role in island life.
*   **Community Values:** Emphasizing concepts like family, respect, and communal responsibility.

### 4. Storytelling Techniques

Traditional storytellers use various techniques to engage their audience:

*   **Repetition:** Repeating phrases or actions for emphasis and memorability.
*   **Vivid Imagery:** Using descriptive language to create strong mental pictures.
*   **Dialogue:** Bringing characters to life through their spoken words.
*   **Performance:** Incorporating gestures, facial expressions, and vocal changes (especially in oral traditions).
*   **Audience Participation:** Inviting listeners to join in chants, songs, or responses.

### 5. Creative Challenge: Our Kura Story

In small groups, choose one of the following prompts and create a short narrative (oral or written) inspired by the storytelling traditions we've discussed. Think about your audience and purpose.

*   **Prompt A:** A story explaining the origin of a local landmark near Mangakotukutuku College.
*   **Prompt B:** A narrative about a challenge faced by students at our kura, and how they overcame it through teamwork.
*   **Prompt C:** A personal story about a significant cultural event or family tradition.
