## What is Photography?

Photography is the art of capturing light with a camera to create an image. In digital photography, we use a sensor to capture this light.

## The Exposure Triangle

Exposure is how light or dark an image is. It is controlled by three key settings, known as the "Exposure Triangle."

### 1. Aperture
- **What it is:** The size of the opening in the lens.
- **How it's measured:** In f-stops (e.g., f/1.8, f/4, f/16).
- **What it does:** A **large opening** (small f-number like f/1.8) lets in **more light** and creates a shallow depth of field (blurry background). A **small opening** (large f-number like f/16) lets in **less light** and creates a deep depth of field (everything is in focus).

### 2. Shutter Speed
- **What it is:** The amount of time the camera's shutter is open.
- **How it's measured:** In seconds or fractions of a second (e.g., 1/1000s, 1/60s, 1s).
- **What it does:** A **fast shutter speed** (like 1/1000s) freezes motion. A **slow shutter speed** (like 1s) creates motion blur.

### 3. ISO
- **What it is:** The sensor's sensitivity to light.
- **How it's measured:** In numbers like 100, 400, 1600.
- **What it does:** A **low ISO** (like 100) is less sensitive to light and produces a clean image. A **high ISO** (like 1600) is more sensitive, allowing you to shoot in the dark, but it can create "noise" or grain in the image.

## Composition: The Rule of Thirds

One of the most basic rules of composition is the **Rule of Thirds**. Imagine your frame is divided into a 3x3 grid. The rule suggests placing your subject or key elements along these lines or at their intersections. This often creates a more balanced and visually interesting image than simply centering the subject.

## Activity: Photo Challenge

Using a digital camera or a phone with manual controls, try to capture the following:
1.  A photo with a very **shallow depth of field** (blurry background).
2.  A photo that **freezes fast motion**.
3.  A photo that shows **motion blur**.
4.  A photo composed using the **Rule of Thirds**.
