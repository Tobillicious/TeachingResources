## A Shift from Farm to Factory

The Industrial Revolution was a period of profound change in human history. It began in Great Britain in the late 18th century and quickly spread throughout the world. Before the Industrial Revolution, most people lived in rural areas and worked in agriculture. The Industrial Revolution saw a massive shift to urban centers and factory work.

## Key Inventions

Several key inventions drove the Industrial Revolution:
-   **The Steam Engine:** Perfected by James Watt, the steam engine was a powerful new source of energy that could be used to power factories, trains, and ships.
-   **The Spinning Jenny:** Invented by James Hargreaves, this machine could spin multiple spools of thread at once, dramatically increasing the production of textiles.
-   **The Power Loom:** Invented by Edmund Cartwright, this machine automated the process of weaving cloth.

## The Factory System

These new machines led to the development of the **factory system**. For the first time, large numbers of workers were brought together in one place to produce goods on a massive scale.

## Social and Economic Changes

The Industrial Revolution had a huge impact on society:
-   **Urbanization:** Millions of people moved from the countryside to cities to find work in factories. This led to overcrowding, poor sanitation, and difficult living conditions.
-   **New Social Classes:** A new industrial working class emerged, as well as a wealthy industrial middle class of factory owners, inventors, and merchants.
-   **Changing Family Life:** The family was no longer the main unit of production. Men, women, and children all worked long hours in factories, often in dangerous conditions.

## The Legacy of the Industrial Revolution

The Industrial Revolution transformed the world, laying the foundation for modern, industrial society. It led to incredible technological advancements and economic growth, but it also created new social problems and inequalities that we are still grappling with today.
