## Summary

This lesson plan introduces students to the fundamentals of data analysis using spreadsheet software. Students will learn to navigate spreadsheets, input data, apply basic functions (SUM, AVERAGE, COUNT), and create simple charts. The lesson emphasizes the importance of data literacy in everyday life and encourages students to analyze data relevant to their school and community, fostering critical thinking and digital skills.

**Resources:**
*   Computers with spreadsheet software (e.g., Google Sheets, Microsoft Excel, LibreOffice Calc).
*   Whiteboard or projector.
*   Markers/pens.
*   Sample dataset (e.g., fictional student test scores, school attendance data, local weather patterns, or survey results from the school community).
*   Worksheet: "Spreadsheet Data Analysis Practice: Our Kura Data" (to be created by ContentCuratorAgent, using culturally relevant data scenarios).
*   Optional: Examples of data visualizations from news or local reports in New Zealand.

## Overview

**LEARNING AREA:** Mathematics (Statistics), Digital Technologies

**YEAR LEVEL:** Year 7-9 (adaptable for Year 10-13 with extended challenges)

**ACHIEVEMENT OBJECTIVES/TE MATAIAHO LINKS:** Students will collect, display, and interpret data using appropriate methods; understand how data can be used to make informed decisions; develop computational thinking skills through data manipulation; understand the ethical implications of data use (NZC Mathematics, Level 3/4; Digital Technologies, Progress Outcome 3/4; Te Mataiaho: Te Ao Tau - Mathematics, Te Ao Hangarau - Digital Technologies, Te Ao Tangata - Social Sciences).

**KEY COMPETENCIES:** Thinking (analyzing data, interpreting patterns, problem-solving), Managing Self (organizing data, systematic approach), Participating and Contributing (collaborative data collection, discussing findings), Using Language, Symbols, and Texts (interpreting charts, using spreadsheet formulas).

**VALUES:** Whanaungatanga (collaborative data analysis, understanding community needs through data), Manaakitanga (using data responsibly, respecting privacy), Whaiora (using data to improve well-being, e.g., health data, sports performance), Tūrangawaewae (analyzing data related to local environment, cultural events, or school initiatives).

**DURATION:** 75 minutes fixed.

**CULTURAL CONSIDERATIONS & ADAPTATIONS:** Use datasets that reflect the cultural diversity and interests of Mangakotukutuku College (e.g., survey results on favorite cultural activities, sports participation across different ethnic groups); discuss the importance of ethical data collection and representation, particularly when dealing with data about people from diverse backgrounds; explore how data can be used to tell stories about local history or cultural practices; ensure examples are relatable and respectful of all students.

## Core Lesson Components

**DO NOW ACTIVITY:** Present students with a small, unorganized list of numbers (e.g., daily temperatures for a week, number of students who prefer different lunch options). Ask: "How could we organize this to make it easier to understand?" Discuss their ideas, leading to the concept of data organization. (10 minutes)

**LEARNING INTENTION:** To understand what data analysis is and its importance, navigate and input data into a spreadsheet, use basic spreadsheet functions (SUM, AVERAGE, COUNT), and create simple charts to visualize data.

**SUCCESS CRITERIA:** I can define data analysis, input a given dataset into a spreadsheet, correctly use SUM, AVERAGE, and COUNT functions, and create a basic bar or pie chart from data.

**EXIT TICKET:** Students write one thing they learned about spreadsheets and one type of data they would like to analyze about their school or community. (5 minutes)

## Instructions to Teach

Guide students through the fundamentals of data analysis using spreadsheet software by demonstrating data entry and basic functions, facilitating hands-on practice with relevant datasets, and empowering them to visualize and interpret information to draw meaningful conclusions.

## Lesson Content

### What is Data Analysis?

**Data analysis** is the process of inspecting, cleaning, transforming, and modeling data with the goal of discovering useful information, informing conclusions, and supporting decision-making. It's about making sense of numbers and information to find patterns and answer questions.

**Why it's Important:** We encounter data everywhere – in sports, news, weather forecasts, and even social media. Data analysis helps us understand trends, make predictions, and make better choices in our daily lives and for our communities.

### Introducing Spreadsheets

**Spreadsheets** (like Google Sheets or Microsoft Excel) are powerful digital tools for organizing, analyzing, and visualizing data in rows and columns.

*   **Rows:** Go horizontally (numbered 1, 2, 3...). Each row often represents a single record or entry.
*   **Columns:** Go vertically (lettered A, B, C...). Each column often represents a specific type of data (e.g., names, ages, scores).
*   **Cells:** The individual boxes where rows and columns meet (e.g., A1, B5). This is where you enter your data.

### Basic Spreadsheet Functions

Functions are pre-built formulas that perform calculations. You always start a function with an equals sign (`=`).

*   **SUM Function:** Adds up a range of numbers.
    *   `=SUM(A1:A5)` will add the numbers in cells A1 through A5.
    *   *Example:* To find the total points scored by a sports team.
*   **AVERAGE Function:** Calculates the average (mean) of a range of numbers.
    *   `=AVERAGE(B2:D2)` will find the average of cells B2, C2, and D2.
    *   *Example:* To find the average test score for a class.
*   **COUNT Function:** Counts the number of cells in a range that contain numbers.
    *   `=COUNT(A:A)` will count all numerical entries in column A.
    *   *Example:* To count how many students submitted an assignment.

### Data Visualization: Simple Charts

Charts make data easier to understand and help us see patterns and trends quickly.

*   **Bar Chart:** Used to compare different categories or groups. The height of each bar represents the value.
    *   *Example:* Comparing the number of students who prefer different lunch options.
*   **Pie Chart:** Shows parts of a whole. Each slice represents a percentage of the total.
    *   *Example:* Showing the percentage of a school's budget spent on different areas (e.g., teaching, sports, arts).

**How to Create a Chart (General Steps):**
1.  Select the data you want to chart (e.g., column of categories and column of numbers).
2.  Look for an "Insert Chart" or "Charts" option in your spreadsheet software's menu.
3.  Choose the type of chart (e.g., Bar, Pie).
4.  Customize titles and labels to make your chart clear.

### Next Steps

Now that you know the basics, you can use spreadsheets to analyze data from your own life, school, or community. Try collecting some data and putting your new skills to use!
