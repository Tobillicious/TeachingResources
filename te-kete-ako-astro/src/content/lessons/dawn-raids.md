**YEAR LEVEL:** Year 9-13

**ACHIEVEMENT OBJECTIVES/TE MATAIAHO LINKS:** Students will understand how past events have shaped New Zealand society; analyze the causes and consequences of historical events; understand the concepts of discrimination and social justice; explore diverse perspectives on historical narratives (NZC Social Sciences, Level 4/5; Te Mataiaho: Te Ao Tangata - Social Sciences).

**KEY COMPETENCIES:** Thinking (analyzing historical evidence, understanding cause and effect, ethical reasoning), Managing Self (engaging with sensitive historical topics respectfully), Participating and Contributing (discussing historical injustices, understanding pathways to reconciliation), Using Language, Symbols, and Texts (interpreting historical accounts, communicating historical understanding).

**DURATION:** 75 minutes fixed.

**CULTURAL CONSIDERATIONS & ADAPTATIONS:** Approach the topic with sensitivity and respect for the historical trauma experienced by Pasifika communities; ensure that Pasifika student voices and experiences are centered in discussions where appropriate; use relevant Pasifika terms and concepts (e.g., fa'alavelave, tautua) when discussing community support and resilience; connect the historical context to contemporary issues of immigration, racism, and social justice in New Zealand, fostering a safe space for students to share their own family histories if comfortable.

## Core Lesson Components

**DO NOW ACTIVITY:** Display an image from the 1970s in New Zealand (e.g., a street scene, a protest). Ask students: "What do you think life was like in New Zealand in the 1970s? What challenges might people have faced?" Discuss their initial thoughts. (10 minutes)

**LEARNING INTENTION:** To understand the historical context and impact of the Dawn Raids, including who was affected and why, and their legacy in New Zealand society.

**SUCCESS CRITERIA:** I can describe what the Dawn Raids were, identify the main group disproportionately affected, explain one reason why they occurred, and discuss one lasting impact of the raids.

**EXIT TICKET:** Students write one new thing they learned about the Dawn Raids and one question they still have about this period of New Zealand history. (5 minutes)

## Instructions to Teach

Facilitate a sensitive and critical exploration of the Dawn Raids by providing historical context, analyzing primary and secondary sources, and guiding students through discussions on the discriminatory nature and lasting impact of these events on Pasifika communities in Aotearoa New Zealand.

## Lesson Content

### 1. A Shadow in New Zealand's History

In the mid-1970s, New Zealand faced an economic downturn. In this climate of uncertainty, some politicians and media began to unfairly blame Pasifika peoples for economic problems and unemployment. This was despite the fact that many Pasifika people had been encouraged to migrate to New Zealand in the 1950s and 60s to fill labour shortages.

This created a hostile environment where people of Pacific Island descent were unfairly targeted. The government of the time began to crack down on "overstayers"—people who had remained in the country after their visas had expired.

### 2. The Dawn Raids: Aggressive and Discriminatory

This crackdown took the form of aggressive and discriminatory immigration raids, which came to be known as the **"Dawn Raids."** Police and immigration officials would conduct raids on the homes of suspected overstayers, often in the early hours of the morning.

While people of many nationalities were overstaying their visas, statistics show that Pasifika peoples were **disproportionately targeted**. Between 1974 and 1976, while Pacific Islanders made up only about one-third of overstayers, they accounted for over 85% of all prosecutions. People were stopped in the street, at work, or at church and asked to prove their right to be in the country. These actions created a climate of fear and trauma for the entire Pasifika community.

### 3. Legacy and Reconciliation

The Dawn Raids are now widely condemned as a racist and unjust chapter in New Zealand's history. They inflicted lasting trauma on families and communities, and damaged the relationship between the government and Pasifika peoples.

In 2021, the New Zealand government formally apologised for the raids. Prime Minister Jacinda Ardern acknowledged the actions were "discriminatory and have had a lasting and negative impact." The apology was a significant step towards healing and reconciliation, recognising the deep hurt caused and affirming the contribution of Pasifika communities to the fabric of Aotearoa.

### Comprehension & Critical Thinking Questions

    C) To escape the economic downturn.
    D) To participate in cultural exchange.

2.  (Numeracy) The text states Pasifika peoples accounted for over 85% of prosecutions for overstaying. If there were 1,000 prosecutions in total, approximately how many would have involved Pacific Islanders?

3.  What does the term "disproportionately targeted" mean in the context of the second paragraph?
    A) The raids were carried out fairly across all ethnic groups.
    B) Pasifika peoples were targeted more than other groups, relative to their number of overstayers.
    C) Only Pasifika peoples were overstaying their visas.

4.  (Critical Thinking) How did the government's actions create a "climate of fear" for the entire Pasifika community, not just overstayers?

5.  (Critical Thinking) Why was the formal government apology in 2021 an important step? What does an apology like this achieve?
