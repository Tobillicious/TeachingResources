## Who Was William Shakespeare?

William Shakespeare (1564-1616) is widely regarded as the greatest writer in the English language and the world's pre-eminent dramatist. He was a playwright, poet, and actor from Stratford-upon-Avon, England.

## Life in Elizabethan England

Shakespeare lived during a time of great change and discovery known as the Elizabethan Era, named after Queen Elizabeth I. London was a bustling, crowded city, and the theatre was a hugely popular form of entertainment for people from all social classes.

## The Globe Theatre

Many of Shakespeare's most famous plays were performed at the Globe Theatre in London. It was an open-air theatre that could hold up to 3,000 people.
-   The wealthy sat in covered galleries.
-   The commoners, known as "groundlings," stood in the open yard in front of the stage for a penny.

## Shakespeare's Works

Shakespeare wrote approximately 39 plays, 154 sonnets, and two long narrative poems. His plays are typically categorized into three genres:

### 1. Comedies
These plays often involve mistaken identity, clever wordplay, and a happy ending that usually includes a marriage.
-   *Examples: A Midsummer Night's Dream, Much Ado About Nothing, Twelfth Night.*

### 2. Tragedies
These plays explore the downfall of a noble hero due to a fatal flaw (hamartia). They are serious in tone and end in death and disaster.
-   *Examples: Hamlet, Macbeth, Romeo and Juliet, Othello.*

### 3. Histories
These plays are based on the lives of English kings.
-   *Examples: Richard III, Henry V.*

## Why Do We Still Study Shakespeare?

Even 400 years after his death, Shakespeare's works are still performed and studied all over the world. This is because he wrote about universal human experiences that are still relevant today: love, jealousy, ambition, grief, and revenge. He was also a master of language, and he invented thousands of words and phrases that we still use in English today (e.g., "eyeball," "swagger," "break the ice").
