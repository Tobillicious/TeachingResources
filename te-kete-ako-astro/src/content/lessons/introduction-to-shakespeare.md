## Do Now: Modern Language
Think of a modern slang word or phrase (e.g., "spill the tea," "GOAT"). In your book, write a short definition of what it means and use it in a sentence. Be prepared to share. This is how language evolves, just as it did in Shakespeare's time!

## Who Was William Shakespeare?

William Shakespeare (1564-1616) is widely regarded as the greatest writer in the English language and the world's pre-eminent dramatist. He was a playwright, poet, and actor from Stratford-upon-Avon, England.

## Life in Elizabethan England

Shakespeare lived during a time of great change and discovery known as the Elizabethan Era, named after Queen Elizabeth I. London was a bustling, crowded city, and the theatre was a hugely popular form of entertainment for people from all social classes.

## The Globe Theatre

Many of Shakespeare's most famous plays were performed at the Globe Theatre in London. It was an open-air theatre that could hold up to 3,000 people.
-   The wealthy sat in covered galleries.
-   The commoners, known as "groundlings," stood in the open yard in front of the stage for a penny.

## Shakespeare's Works

Shakespeare wrote approximately 39 plays, 154 sonnets, and two long narrative poems. His plays are typically categorized into three genres:

### 1. Comedies
These plays often involve mistaken identity, clever wordplay, and a happy ending that usually includes a marriage.
-   *Examples: A Midsummer Night's Dream, Much Ado About Nothing, Twelfth Night.*

### 2. Tragedies
These plays explore the downfall of a noble hero due to a fatal flaw (hamartia). They are serious in tone and end in death and disaster.
-   *Examples: Hamlet, Macbeth, Romeo and Juliet, Othello.*

### 3. Histories
These plays are based on the lives of English kings.
-   *Examples: Richard III, Henry V.*

Shakespeare wrote in a style of English that can be difficult for modern readers to understand. However, his language is also incredibly rich and poetic. He was a master of **iambic pentameter**, a rhythmic pattern that gives his verse a natural, song-like quality.

## Why Do We Still Study Shakespeare?

Even 400 years after his death, Shakespeare's works are still performed and studied all over the world. This is because he wrote about universal human experiences that are still relevant today: love, jealousy, ambition, grief, and revenge. He was also a master of language, and he invented thousands of words and phrases that we still use in English today (e.g., "eyeball," "swagger," "break the ice").

## Activity: Modernize a Scene
In small groups, take a short, famous scene from a Shakespeare play (e.g., the balcony scene from *Romeo and Juliet*). Your task is to "translate" the scene into modern, everyday language, including modern slang. Be prepared to perform your modernized scene for the class.
