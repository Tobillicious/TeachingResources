## What is Electricity?

At its most basic, electricity is the flow of tiny particles called **electrons**. When these electrons move, they carry electrical energy from one place to another.

## The Simple Circuit

For electricity to flow, it needs a complete path, called a **circuit**. A simple circuit has three main parts:
1.  **Power Source:** Provides the energy (e.g., a battery).
2.  **Load:** The device that uses the energy (e.g., a light bulb).
3.  **Conductor:** The path the electrons follow (e.g., a wire).

If there is a break anywhere in the circuit, the electricity will stop flowing.

## Key Concepts

### Voltage (V)
Voltage is the "push" or "pressure" that makes the electrons move. It's like the water pressure in a hose. It is measured in **Volts (V)**.

### Current (I)
Current is the measure of how many electrons are flowing past a certain point in the circuit. It's like the amount of water flowing through the hose. It is measured in **Amperes (A)**, or Amps.

### Resistance (R)
Resistance is a measure of how difficult it is for electrons to flow through a material. A thin wire has more resistance than a thick wire. It is measured in **Ohms (Ω)**.

## Ohm's Law

These three concepts are related by a very important formula called Ohm's Law:

**Voltage = Current × Resistance (V = IR)**

This means that for the same voltage, if you increase the resistance, the current will decrease.

## Activity: Build a Simple Circuit

Using a battery, wires, and a small light bulb, work in groups to build a simple circuit.
1.  Can you make the light bulb turn on?
2.  What happens if you disconnect one of the wires?
3.  (If available) Add a switch to your circuit. How does it work?
