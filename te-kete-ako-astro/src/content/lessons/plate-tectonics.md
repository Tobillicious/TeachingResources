## The Earth's Layers

Our planet is made up of several layers:
-   **Crust:** The thin, rocky outer layer.
-   **Mantle:** A thick layer of hot, semi-solid rock.
-   **Core:** The extremely hot, dense center of the Earth.

The **lithosphere**, which is made up of the crust and the upper part of the mantle, is not one solid piece. It is broken into many large and small pieces called **tectonic plates**.

## The Theory of Plate Tectonics

The theory of plate tectonics states that these plates are constantly moving, floating on the semi-fluid asthenosphere below. They move at a rate of a few centimeters per year, about the same speed that your fingernails grow.

## Plate Boundaries

The most geologically active areas on Earth are at the boundaries where plates meet. There are three main types of plate boundaries:

### 1. Divergent Boundaries
Where two plates are moving **apart**. Magma from the mantle rises to the surface, creating new crust. This is how mid-ocean ridges are formed.

### 2. Convergent Boundaries
Where two plates are moving **towards each other**. This can result in:
-   **Subduction:** One plate slides beneath the other, often causing earthquakes and creating volcanic mountain ranges. This is common around the "Ring of Fire" in the Pacific Ocean.
-   **Collision:** Two continental plates collide, pushing up massive mountain ranges like the Himalayas.

### 3. Transform Boundaries
Where two plates are **sliding past each other** horizontally. This movement is not smooth, and the plates can get stuck. When the pressure builds up and is suddenly released, it causes an **earthquake**. The San Andreas Fault in California is a famous example.

## New Zealand: A Plate Boundary Country

Aotearoa New Zealand sits directly on the boundary between the Pacific Plate and the Australian Plate. This is why we experience frequent earthquakes and have active volcanoes.
