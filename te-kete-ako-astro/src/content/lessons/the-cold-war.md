## A Clash of Ideologies

After World War II, the world was left with two superpowers with fundamentally different beliefs:
-   **The United States:** A capitalist democracy that valued individual freedom and free markets.
-   **The Soviet Union (USSR):** A communist state where the government controlled the economy and society.

This clash of ideologies led to a period of intense geopolitical tension known as the **Cold War**, which lasted from roughly 1947 to 1991. It was "cold" because the two superpowers never directly fought each other in a major war, but they engaged in proxy wars, an arms race, and a struggle for global influence.

## Key Concepts

### The Iron Curtain
A term coined by Winston Churchill to describe the ideological and physical boundary dividing Europe into two separate areas from the end of WWII until the end of the Cold War.

### Containment
The primary foreign policy of the United States during the Cold War. The goal was to "contain" the spread of communism and prevent it from expanding to other countries.

### The Arms Race
A competition between the US and the USSR for supremacy in nuclear warfare. Both sides built up massive arsenals of nuclear weapons, leading to a state of "Mutually Assured Destruction" (MAD), where a nuclear attack by one side would be met with a devastating counter-attack from the other.

### Proxy Wars
The US and the USSR fought each other indirectly by supporting opposing sides in conflicts in other parts of the world, such as the Korean War and the Vietnam War.

## The End of the Cold War

The Cold War began to thaw in the late 1980s due to economic stagnation in the Soviet Union and a series of reformist policies by Soviet leader Mikhail Gorbachev. The symbolic end of the Cold War was the **fall of the Berlin Wall in 1989**, and the conflict officially ended with the dissolution of the Soviet Union in 1991.
