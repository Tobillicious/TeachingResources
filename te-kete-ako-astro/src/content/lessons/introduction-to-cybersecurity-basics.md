## Summary

This lesson plan introduces students to essential cybersecurity concepts, including defining cyber threats and implementing basic online safety practices. Through engaging discussions and practical advice, students will learn to protect their personal information and devices, fostering responsible digital citizenship within the unique cultural context of Mangakotukutuku College.

**Resources:**
*   Whiteboard or projector.
*   Markers/pens.
*   Handout: "Cybersecurity Checklist for Our Kura" (to be created by ContentCuratorAgent, focusing on relevant local scenarios).
*   Optional: Short video clips demonstrating common cyber threats (e.g., phishing examples, safe password practices).
*   Optional: Information on Netsafe NZ (New Zealand's online safety organisation).

## Overview

**LEARNING AREA:** Digital Technologies

**YEAR LEVEL:** Year 8-10 (adaptable for Year 7-13 with differentiated activities)

**ACHIEVEMENT OBJECTIVES/TE MATAIAHO LINKS:** Students will understand how digital systems work and their impact on society; identify and explain common cyber threats; apply safe and ethical practices when interacting online; understand the importance of protecting personal information (NZC Digital Technologies, Progress Outcome 3/4; Te Mataiaho: Te Ao Hangarau - Digital Technologies, Te Ao Tangata - Social Sciences).

**KEY COMPETENCIES:** Thinking (analyzing risks, problem-solving, critical evaluation of online information), Managing Self (responsible online behaviour, self-protection), Participating and Contributing (promoting online safety in their community, being an upstander against cyberbullying), Using Language, Symbols, and Texts (interpreting online cues, understanding privacy policies).

**VALUES:** Whanaungatanga (fostering a safe and supportive online community, protecting peers from harm), Manaakitanga (caring for self and others online, promoting digital well-being), Whaiora (ensuring a positive and secure online experience), T큰rangawaewae (understanding digital identity and its connection to personal and cultural space, discussing data sovereignty for M훮ori/Pasifika).

**DURATION:** 75 minutes fixed.

**CULTURAL CONSIDERATIONS & ADAPTATIONS:** Discuss the importance of protecting personal and wh훮nau (family) information online, considering cultural sensitivities around sharing; explore how online safety principles apply to communication within M훮ori and Pasifika community groups; use examples of online scams or threats that might specifically target diverse communities; emphasize the concept of digital kaitiakitanga (guardianship) over one's online presence and data.

## Core Lesson Components

**DO NOW ACTIVITY:** Ask students: "What is the most important rule for staying safe online?" Discuss their initial thoughts, leading into the broader concept of cybersecurity. (10 minutes)

**LEARNING INTENTION:** To define cybersecurity, identify common cyber threats, implement basic practices for creating strong passwords and using two-factor authentication, and understand the risks of sharing personal information online.

**SUCCESS CRITERIA:** I can define cybersecurity and explain its importance, identify at least two common cyber threats, describe how to create a strong password and use 2FA, and explain one risk of oversharing online.

**EXIT TICKET:** Students write one new online safety tip they learned today and commit to implementing it. (5 minutes)

## Instructions to Teach

Facilitate an interactive lesson on cybersecurity by defining key threats, demonstrating practical safety measures, and guiding students through discussions on responsible online behavior and the protection of personal information, emphasizing culturally relevant contexts and digital kaitiakitanga.

## Lesson Content

### What is Cybersecurity?

**Cybersecurity** is the practice of protecting computer systems, networks, and programs from digital attacks, damage, or unauthorized access. It's about keeping your information and devices safe in the online world.

**Why it Matters:** In today's digital age, almost everything we do involves technology. From online banking to social media, our personal information is constantly being shared. Cyberattacks can lead to identity theft, financial loss, privacy breaches, and even harm to our well-being. Understanding cybersecurity helps us protect ourselves and our communities.

### Common Cyber Threats

*   **Phishing:** Deceptive emails, messages, or websites designed to trick you into revealing personal information (e.g., fake bank emails asking for your password).
*   **Malware:** Malicious software (like viruses, worms, ransomware) designed to damage your computer, steal data, or gain unauthorized access.
*   **Social Engineering:** Manipulating people into performing actions or divulging confidential information, often by exploiting trust or curiosity.
*   **Weak Passwords:** Passwords that are easy to guess or crack, making accounts vulnerable.
*   **Public Wi-Fi Risks:** Unsecured public networks (e.g., in cafes) where your data can be easily intercepted by others.

### Basic Cybersecurity Practices

1.  **Strong, Unique Passwords:** Use long, complex passwords (mix of letters, numbers, symbols) for each account. Consider using a password manager.
2.  **Two-Factor Authentication (2FA):** Adds an extra layer of security. Even if someone has your password, they can't access your account without a second verification (e.g., a code sent to your phone).
3.  **Be Wary of Links and Attachments:** Don't click on suspicious links or open attachments from unknown senders. If it looks too good to be true, it probably is.
4.  **Keep Software Updated:** Regular updates often include security patches that fix vulnerabilities.
5.  **Backup Data:** Regularly save important files to an external hard drive or cloud service in case your device is compromised.
6.  **Review Privacy Settings:** Regularly check and adjust privacy settings on social media, apps, and websites to control who sees your information.
7.  **Public Wi-Fi Caution:** Avoid accessing sensitive information (like banking) on unsecured public Wi-Fi. Use a VPN if possible.

### Protecting Personal Information Online

Think carefully about what personal information you share online (e.g., full name, address, phone number, photos, location, school name). Oversharing can lead to:

*   **Identity Theft:** Criminals using your information for fraudulent activities.
*   **Cyberbullying:** Being targeted with harmful messages or content.
*   **Unwanted Attention:** Being contacted by strangers.
*   **Privacy Breaches:** Your information being accessed or used without your consent.

**Think Before You Post:** Always consider the long-term implications of what you share online. Once it's out there, it's hard to take back.
