## What is Animation?

Animation is the process of creating the illusion of movement by rapidly displaying a sequence of static images. It works because of a phenomenon called **persistence of vision**, where our eyes briefly retain an image for a fraction of a second after it disappears. When images are shown in quick succession, our brain blends them together into a moving image.

## Early Animation: The Flipbook

The simplest way to understand animation is with a **flipbook**. By drawing a slightly different image on each page of a notepad and then flipping through the pages quickly, you can create a short animation.

## Types of Animation

### 1. Traditional Animation (Cel Animation)
This is the classic animation technique used in films like *Snow White* and *The Lion King*. Each frame is drawn by hand on a transparent sheet called a "cel."

### 2. Stop Motion Animation
This involves physically manipulating real-world objects and photographing them one frame at a time.
-   **Claymation:** Uses figures made of clay or a similar malleable material (e.g., *Wallace and Gromit*).
-   **Puppet Animation:** Uses puppets (e.g., *The Nightmare Before Christmas*).
-   **Cutout Animation:** Uses characters and objects made from paper or card (e.g., *South Park*).

### 3. Computer Animation
This is the most common form of animation today.
-   **2D Animation:** Uses computer software to create the illusion of movement in a two-dimensional space. It often mimics the look of traditional animation.
-   **3D Animation (CGI):** Uses computer graphics to create three-dimensional models and environments. The computer then calculates how these models should move and be rendered. (e.g., *Toy Story*, *Shrek*).

## The 12 Principles of Animation

Developed by Disney animators in the 1930s, the 12 Principles of Animation are a set of guidelines for creating more realistic and appealing animation. These include concepts like "Squash and Stretch," "Anticipation," and "Timing."

## Activity: Create a Flipbook

Using a small notepad or a stack of sticky notes, create your own simple flipbook animation. It could be a bouncing ball, a waving stick figure, or a growing flower.
