## How is Aotearoa New Zealand Governed?

New Zealand is a **constitutional monarchy** and a **parliamentary democracy**. Our system of government has three main parts, or "branches," but they are not as strictly separated as in some other countries.

### 1. Parliament (The Legislature)
The Legislature is responsible for **making and changing laws**. In New Zealand, our Legislature is the **House of Representatives**, which we call Parliament. It is made up of all the Members of Parliament (MPs) who are chosen by the people in a general election.

### 2. The Government (The Executive)
The Executive is responsible for **running the country and enforcing the laws**. This branch is led by the **Prime Minister** and their senior ministers, who form a group called **Cabinet**. The Executive branch proposes new laws and manages government departments (like the Ministry of Health or the Police).

**Important Note:** In New Zealand, the Executive (the Government) is drawn *from* the Legislature (Parliament). The Prime Minister is the leader of the party that can command a majority of votes in the House. This is a "fusion of powers," not a strict separation.

### 3. The Courts (The Judiciary)
The Judiciary is responsible for **interpreting the laws**. This is our court system. Judges are independent of the other two branches. They make sure laws are applied fairly and can decide on legal disputes. The highest court in New Zealand is the **Supreme Court**.

## The Role of the Head of State

New Zealand's Head of State is the King or Queen of the United Kingdom, who is represented in New Zealand by the **Governor-General**. The Governor-General gives "Royal Assent" to bills passed by Parliament, which is the final step for a bill to become law.
