## Why Do Atoms Bond?

Atoms form chemical bonds to achieve a more stable state. For most atoms, this means having a full outer shell of electrons, like the noble gases. Atoms can achieve this by either transferring or sharing electrons.

## 1. Ionic Bonds: The Giver and the Taker

An ionic bond is formed when one atom **transfers** one or more electrons to another atom. This creates **ions**—atoms that have a positive or negative electrical charge.
-   The atom that **loses** an electron becomes a **positive ion** (cation).
-   The atom that **gains** an electron becomes a **negative ion** (anion).

The oppositely charged ions are then attracted to each other, like the north and south poles of a magnet. This attraction is the ionic bond.

**Example:** Sodium (Na) has one electron in its outer shell, and Chlorine (Cl) has seven. Sodium gives its electron to Chlorine. Now, Sodium is a positive ion (Na+) and Chlorine is a negative ion (Cl-). They are strongly attracted to each other, forming Sodium Chloride (NaCl), or table salt.

Ionic bonds typically form between a **metal** and a **non-metal**.

## 2. Covalent Bonds: The Sharers

A covalent bond is formed when two atoms **share** one or more pairs of electrons. By sharing, each atom feels like it has a full outer shell.

**Example:** A water molecule (H₂O) is formed by covalent bonds. Oxygen needs two more electrons to have a full outer shell. Each Hydrogen atom has one electron. The Oxygen atom shares its electrons with two Hydrogen atoms, and everyone is stable.

Covalent bonds typically form between **two non-metals**.

## Activity: Bonding Role-Play

In groups, assign students to be different atoms (e.g., Sodium, Chlorine, Oxygen, Hydrogen). Give them a certain number of "electron" tokens. Have them act out the process of ionic and covalent bonding by transferring or sharing their tokens to form stable compounds.
