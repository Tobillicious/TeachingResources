## Lesson Content

### 1. Money in a Digital World

Our world is increasingly digital, and so is our money! From online shopping to banking apps, understanding how to manage your money in a digital environment is a crucial life skill. This lesson will build on basic financial literacy to focus on the digital aspects.

### 2. Budgeting and Saving in the Digital Age

**Budgeting:** Creating a plan for how you will spend and save your money. It helps you track where your money comes from (income) and where it goes (expenses).

*   **Digital Budgeting Tools:** Many banking apps and free online tools (like Sorted.org.nz's budget planner) can help you track your spending automatically and categorize expenses.
*   **Why Budget?** To ensure you don't spend more than you earn, save for goals (e.g., a new phone, school trip, tertiary education), and reduce financial stress.

**Saving:** Setting aside money for future goals.

*   **Automated Savings:** Set up automatic transfers from your spending account to a savings account each payday. "Set and forget!"
*   **Emergency Fund:** Aim to save 3-6 months of living expenses for unexpected events. This is your financial safety net.
*   **KiwiSaver:** New Zealand's voluntary retirement savings scheme. If you're working, your employer contributes, and the government might too! It's a great way to save for your first home or retirement.

### 3. Digital Payment Methods

Beyond cash, there are many ways to pay digitally:

*   **Debit Cards:** Linked directly to your bank account. Money comes out immediately.
*   **Credit Cards:** Allow you to borrow money up to a limit. You pay it back later, often with interest. Use with caution!
*   **Paywave / Tap & Go:** Contactless payments using your card or phone.
*   **Online Banking / Banking Apps:** Transfer money, pay bills, check balances from your phone or computer.
*   **Mobile Payment Apps:** (e.g., Apple Pay, Google Pay) Store your card details on your phone for quick payments.

### 4. Online Financial Risks & How to Stay Safe

While digital money is convenient, it comes with risks. Be aware and stay safe:

*   **Phishing Scams:** Fake emails or texts pretending to be from banks or trusted organizations, trying to get your personal or banking details. **Always check the sender and look for suspicious links!**
*   **Online Fraud:** Scammers trying to trick you into sending them money or giving them access to your accounts.
*   **Identity Theft:** Criminals stealing your personal information to commit fraud.
*   **Weak Passwords:** Easy-to-guess passwords make your online accounts vulnerable.
*   **Public Wi-Fi:** Avoid doing online banking or sensitive transactions on unsecured public Wi-Fi networks.

**Tips for Online Financial Safety:**
1.  Use strong, unique passwords for all financial accounts.
2.  Enable Two-Factor Authentication (2FA) wherever possible.
3.  Be skeptical of unsolicited emails, texts, or calls asking for financial information.
4.  Only use secure websites (look for `https://` and a padlock symbol).
5.  Regularly check your bank statements for suspicious activity.
6.  Keep your devices and software updated.

### 5. Discussion & Call to Action

*   How can financial literacy empower you and your whānau in the digital world?
*   What are some financial goals you have for the future, and how might digital tools help you achieve them?
*   How can we share financial literacy knowledge within our Mangakotukutuku College community?
