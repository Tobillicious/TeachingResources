## Summary

This lesson plan delves into the local impacts of climate change within Aotearoa New Zealand, moving beyond global concepts to explore specific challenges faced by communities, including Māori and Pasifika. Students will investigate local climate phenomena, analyze their social and environmental consequences, and critically examine culturally responsive solutions and adaptation strategies. The lesson aims to foster environmental literacy, promote a sense of agency, and connect scientific understanding with indigenous knowledge systems and community action.

**Resources:**
*   Whiteboard or projector.
*   Markers/pens.
*   Maps of New Zealand showing vulnerable coastal areas or regions affected by extreme weather.
*   Video clips or news articles on local climate change impacts in NZ (e.g., sea-level rise in specific communities, changes in agricultural patterns, impacts on kaimoana/seafood).
*   Handout: "Local Climate Impacts & Solutions" (to be created by ContentCuratorAgent, including case studies).
*   Optional: Guest speaker from a local environmental group or iwi/hapū involved in climate action.

## Overview

**LEARNING AREA:** Science (Planet Earth and Beyond, Living World), Social Sciences (Environment, Geography, Citizenship)

**YEAR LEVEL:** Year 10-13

**ACHIEVEMENT OBJECTIVES/TE MATAIAHO LINKS:** Students will understand human impact on the environment and propose solutions; explore concepts of sustainability and global interconnectedness; analyze scientific information and societal responses; understand diverse perspectives on environmental issues and community resilience (NZC Science, Level 5; Social Sciences, Level 5; Te Mataiaho: Te Ao Tūroa - The Natural World, Te Ao Tangata - Social Sciences).

**KEY COMPETENCIES:** Thinking (analyzing complex environmental problems, evaluating solutions, critical reasoning), Managing Self (considering personal environmental footprint, responsible consumption, fostering hope), Participating and Contributing (engaging in discussions about climate action, understanding collective responsibility, advocating for change), Using Language, Symbols, and Texts (interpreting scientific data, understanding environmental reports, communicating solutions).

**VALUES:** Whanaungatanga (collective responsibility for environmental well-being, understanding global and local impacts), Manaakitanga (caring for the environment and future generations, protecting vulnerable communities), Whaiora (promoting a healthy planet for all, fostering resilience), Tūrangawaewae (connecting climate change impacts to local environments in Aotearoa, discussing Māori and Pasifika perspectives on kaitiakitanga and the interconnectedness of land, sea, and people).

**DURATION:** 75 minutes fixed.

**CULTURAL CONSIDERATIONS & ADAPTATIONS:** Discuss Māori concepts of kaitiakitanga (guardianship) in relation to the environment and climate change, emphasizing the intergenerational responsibility; explore how climate change disproportionately affects Pacific Island nations and coastal Māori communities, linking to concepts of displacement and resilience; use examples of climate change impacts and adaptation strategies specific to New Zealand (e.g., sea-level rise in specific coastal marae, impacts on traditional food sources like kaimoana); encourage students to consider indigenous knowledge and practices in addressing environmental challenges; ensure discussions are inclusive and respectful of all viewpoints, particularly those from communities directly impacted by climate change.

## Core Lesson Components

**DO NOW ACTIVITY:** Show a local news headline or image related to a recent extreme weather event in New Zealand (e.g., a flood, drought, or storm). Ask students: "How might this event be connected to climate change? What impacts might it have on our community?" Discuss their initial thoughts. (10 minutes)

**LEARNING INTENTION (WALT):** We are learning to understand the local impacts of climate change in Aotearoa New Zealand and explore culturally responsive solutions and adaptation strategies.

**SUCCESS CRITERIA (TIB):** I can identify at least two local impacts of climate change in New Zealand, explain one way climate change affects Māori or Pasifika communities, and propose one culturally responsive solution or adaptation strategy.

**EXIT TICKET:** Students write one local climate change impact they are concerned about and one action they believe their school or community could take to address it. (5 minutes)

## Instructions to Teach

Guide students through an exploration of climate change by focusing on its specific impacts within Aotearoa New Zealand, facilitating discussions on culturally responsive solutions and adaptation strategies, and empowering them to connect scientific understanding with local community action and indigenous knowledge.

## Lesson Content

### 1. Climate Change in Aotearoa: A Local Reality

While climate change is a global issue, its impacts are felt locally. In Aotearoa New Zealand, we are already experiencing changes that affect our environment, communities, and way of life. These impacts are often felt most acutely by Māori and Pasifika communities, who have deep connections to the land and sea.

### 2. Local Impacts of Climate Change in New Zealand

*   **Rising Sea Levels:** Threatening low-lying coastal communities, including many marae and urupā (cemeteries). This can lead to coastal erosion and saltwater intrusion into freshwater sources.
*   **More Frequent and Intense Extreme Weather Events:** Increased frequency of floods, droughts, heatwaves, and severe storms, impacting agriculture, infrastructure, and human health.
*   **Changes in Rainfall Patterns:** Some regions experiencing more intense rainfall (leading to floods and landslides), while others face prolonged droughts.
*   **Impacts on Biodiversity:** Changes in temperature and rainfall affect native species and ecosystems, including unique flora and fauna.
*   **Ocean Acidification:** Affecting marine ecosystems, including kaimoana (seafood) species important for cultural practices and livelihoods.
*   **Impacts on Primary Industries:** Agriculture and horticulture are vulnerable to changes in climate, affecting crop yields and livestock.

### 3. Culturally Responsive Solutions and Adaptation

Addressing climate change in Aotearoa requires solutions that are not only scientifically sound but also culturally responsive, drawing on indigenous knowledge and community strengths.

*   **Kaitiakitanga (Guardianship):** Māori principles of guardianship over the environment are crucial. This involves actively protecting and restoring natural resources for future generations.
*   **Community-led Adaptation:** Local communities, particularly iwi and hapū, are developing their own strategies to adapt to climate change impacts, such as relocating marae, restoring coastal ecosystems, and developing resilient food systems.
*   **Sustainable Land Management:** Implementing practices that reduce emissions from agriculture and forestry, and enhance carbon sequestration (e.g., planting native trees, regenerative farming).
*   **Renewable Energy Transition:** Continuing New Zealand's shift towards renewable energy sources like geothermal, hydro, wind, and solar power to reduce reliance on fossil fuels.
*   **Traditional Knowledge Integration:** Combining scientific knowledge with mātauranga Māori (Māori knowledge) to develop holistic and effective solutions.
*   **Youth Advocacy:** Young people, including those from Mangakotukutuku College, playing a vital role in advocating for climate action and raising awareness.

### 4. Discussion & Call to Action

*   What are some specific climate change impacts you have observed or heard about in your local area or in New Zealand?
*   How can individuals, families, and communities contribute to addressing climate change in a way that respects cultural values?
*   What role do you think Mangakotukutuku College can play in promoting climate action and sustainability?
