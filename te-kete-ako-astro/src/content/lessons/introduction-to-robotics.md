## Summary

This lesson plan provides an engaging introduction to the world of robotics, covering fundamental concepts such as robot definition, key components, and diverse real-world applications. Students will explore the ethical implications of robotics and consider its future impact, fostering critical thinking and an appreciation for technological innovation within a culturally responsive framework.

**Resources:**
*   Whiteboard or projector.
*   Markers/pens.
*   Images or short videos of different types of robots (industrial, humanoid, drone, medical, agricultural robots used in NZ).
*   Optional: Simple robotic kit or toy robot for demonstration (e.g., a programmable robot like a Bee-Bot or Edison robot).
*   Worksheet: "Robot Components and Applications" (to be created by ContentCuratorAgent, focusing on local or culturally relevant examples).
*   Optional: News articles or short documentaries on robotics in New Zealand (e.g., agricultural robotics, healthcare automation).

## Overview

**LEARNING AREA:** Digital Technologies

**YEAR LEVEL:** Year 8-10 (adaptable for Year 7-13 with extended challenges)

**ACHIEVEMENT OBJECTIVES/TE MATAIAHO LINKS:** Students will understand how digital systems work and their impact on society; identify and explain the components of a robotic system; explore the ethical considerations of emerging technologies; develop an understanding of how technology can be used to solve problems (NZC Digital Technologies, Progress Outcome 3/4; Te Mataiaho: Te Ao Hangarau - Digital Technologies, Te Ao Tangata - Social Sciences).

**KEY COMPETENCIES:** Thinking (analyzing systems, problem-solving, ethical reasoning), Managing Self (engaging with complex ideas, developing informed opinions), Participating and Contributing (collaborative discussion on ethical dilemmas, understanding societal impact), Using Language, Symbols, and Texts (interpreting technical information, articulating ideas).

**VALUES:** Whanaungatanga (collaborative problem-solving, understanding diverse perspectives on technology), Manaakitanga (considering the well-being of people and the environment in technological development), Whaiora (fostering curiosity and innovation in digital creation), Tūrangawaewae (connecting robotics to local industries, cultural practices, and future opportunities in Aotearoa).

**DURATION:** 75 minutes fixed.

**CULTURAL CONSIDERATIONS & ADAPTATIONS:** Discuss how traditional Māori tools or mechanisms might be seen as early forms of automation or problem-solving devices; explore ethical discussions around AI and robotics from diverse cultural perspectives, including Māori concepts of mauri (life force) and tapu (sacredness) in relation to artificial creations; use examples of robotics applications in New Zealand agriculture, healthcare, or environmental conservation that are relevant to students' backgrounds.

## Core Lesson Components

**DO NOW ACTIVITY:** Show a short video clip of a robot performing a task (e.g., a robot vacuum, a factory robot, a drone). Ask students: "What makes this a 'robot'? What is it doing?" Discuss their initial ideas and preconceptions. (10 minutes)

**LEARNING INTENTION:** To define what a robot is, identify its key characteristics and main components, recognize various applications of robotics, and discuss its future impact and ethical considerations.

**SUCCESS CRITERIA:** I can define a robot and list its four key characteristics, identify at least three main components of a robot, provide two examples of robotics applications, and articulate one ethical consideration related to robotics.

**EXIT TICKET:** Students write one sentence describing a future job they think robots might do, and one job they think humans will always do better. (5 minutes)

## Instructions to Teach

Guide students through an interactive exploration of robotics by defining its core characteristics and components, showcasing diverse real-world applications, and facilitating a critical discussion on the ethical implications and societal impact of this rapidly evolving technology.

## Lesson Content

### What is a Robot?

A **robot** is a machine designed to carry out a complex series of actions automatically, especially one programmable by computer. Robots are built to perform tasks that might be dangerous, repetitive, or impossible for humans.

**Key Characteristics of a Robot:**
*   **Sensing:** Robots can perceive their environment using **sensors** (like eyes, ears, or touch).
*   **Thinking/Processing:** They can process information and make decisions using a **controller** or **processor** (the brain).
*   **Acting:** They can perform physical actions using **actuators** or **motors** (the muscles).
*   **Programmable:** They can be programmed to perform specific tasks or a series of actions.

### Main Components of a Robot

Think of a robot like a body with different parts working together:

*   **Sensors:** Devices that gather information about the robot's surroundings. (e.g., cameras, ultrasonic sensors for distance, touch sensors).
*   **Actuators/Motors:** Components that enable movement. (e.g., electric motors for wheels, hydraulic cylinders for arms).
*   **Controller/Processor:** The computer that processes information from sensors and sends commands to actuators. (e.g., microcontrollers, single-board computers like a Raspberry Pi).
*   **Power Source:** Provides electricity to the robot. (e.g., batteries, power outlets).
*   **End Effector/Manipulator:** The part of the robot that interacts with its environment to perform tasks. (e.g., grippers, tools, wheels, robotic arms).
*   **Chassis/Frame:** The physical structure that holds all the components together (the skeleton).

### Applications of Robotics

Robots are used in many different fields, making our lives easier and safer:

*   **Manufacturing:** Building cars, assembling electronics, welding in factories.
*   **Healthcare:** Assisting in surgeries (e.g., da Vinci surgical system), dispensing medication, helping with rehabilitation.
*   **Exploration:** Space probes (like the Mars rovers), underwater drones exploring the ocean floor.
*   **Logistics/Warehousing:** Sorting packages, moving goods in large warehouses (e.g., Amazon fulfillment centers).
*   **Service Industry:** Robot vacuum cleaners (Roomba), automated coffee makers, delivery robots.
*   **Agriculture:** Automated harvesting, precision spraying, crop monitoring (e.g., robots used in New Zealand's kiwifruit orchards).
*   **Education:** Teaching robots, coding robots used in classrooms.

### Future of Robotics & Ethical Considerations

As robots become more advanced, we need to consider their impact on society:

*   **Job Displacement:** Will robots take human jobs? Or will they create new jobs that require different skills?
*   **Autonomous Weapons:** Should robots be allowed to make life-or-death decisions in warfare?
*   **Human-Robot Interaction:** How will humans and robots coexist and collaborate in daily life and work?
*   **Bias in AI:** If robots are powered by AI, how do we ensure they don't inherit human biases from their programming or data?

These are complex questions with no easy answers, and they are important for us to discuss as we shape the future of technology in Aotearoa.
