## Overview

**LEARNING AREA:** Learning Languages (Te Reo Māori), The Arts (Visual Arts), Social Sciences (Culture and Heritage)

**YEAR LEVEL:** Year 7-9 (adaptable for Year 10-13 with deeper cultural analysis)

**ACHIEVEMENT OBJECTIVES/TE MATAIAHO LINKS:** Students will communicate in Te Reo Māori; understand and appreciate Māori language and culture; explore how visual arts communicate meaning and reflect cultural values; develop intercultural communicative competence (NZC Learning Languages, Level 1/2; The Arts, Level 3/4; Social Sciences, Level 3/4; Te Mataiaho: Te Ao Reo - Language and Communication, Te Ao Rehua - The Arts, Te Ao Tangata - Social Sciences).

**KEY COMPETENCIES:** Thinking (making sense of new vocabulary, analyzing cultural symbolism), Using Language, Symbols, and Texts (pronouncing and using Te Reo Māori, interpreting visual symbols), Relating to Others (using language to connect, understanding cultural perspectives), Managing Self (practicing pronunciation, building confidence).

**VALUES:** Whanaungatanga (connecting through language and culture, fostering a sense of belonging), Manaakitanga (showing respect for Te Reo Māori and Māori cultural expressions), Whaiora (fostering enjoyment and confidence in language learning, appreciating cultural richness), Tūrangawaewae (understanding the significance of Te Reo Māori as a taonga, connecting colours to local landscapes and cultural narratives).

**DURATION:** 75 minutes fixed.

**CULTURAL CONSIDERATIONS & ADAPTATIONS:** Emphasize that learning Te Reo Māori is a journey of cultural understanding; discuss the spiritual and symbolic meanings of traditional Māori colours (e.g., red for mana, black for the underworld, white for purity) and how they are used in art and ceremony; use visual examples of Māori art from local iwi or hapū (if appropriate and with permission) to illustrate colour usage; encourage students to identify colours in their own cultural contexts and share their significance; ensure a safe and encouraging environment for all students to attempt speaking Te Reo Māori, regardless of their prior experience.

## Core Lesson Components

**DO NOW ACTIVITY:** Display a rainbow image or a collection of colourful objects. Ask students: "How many colours can you name in English? Do you know any colours in other languages?" Introduce the idea of learning colours in Te Reo Māori. (10 minutes)

**LEARNING INTENTION (WALT):** We are learning to identify and use basic Te Reo Māori vocabulary for colours (ngā tae) and understand their cultural significance in Māori art and symbolism.

**SUCCESS CRITERIA (TIB):** I can name at least five colours in Te Reo Māori, pronounce them correctly, and explain the cultural significance of at least one traditional Māori colour.

**EXIT TICKET:** Students draw a simple object and label it with its Te Reo Māori colour, and write one sentence about why colours are important in Māori culture. (5 minutes)

## Instructions to Teach

Introduce basic Te Reo Māori colour vocabulary through interactive pronunciation practice and visual aids, then guide students to explore the cultural significance of these colours in Māori art and symbolism through analysis of examples and discussion, fostering language acquisition and cultural understanding.

## Lesson Content

### 1. Ngā Tae: Colours in Te Reo Māori

Learning colours is a great way to start speaking Te Reo Māori! Here are some basic colours:

*   **Whero** (fay-roh) - Red
*   **Kākāriki** (kaa-kaa-ree-kee) - Green
*   **Kikorangi** (kee-koh-rah-ngee) - Blue
*   **Kōwhai** (koh-fai) - Yellow
*   **Pango** (pah-ngoh) - Black
*   **Mā** (maa) - White
*   **Parauri** (pah-rau-ree) - Brown
*   **Waiporoporo** (wai-poh-roh-poh-roh) - Purple
*   **Karaka** (kah-rah-kah) - Orange

**Activity:** Practice pronunciation of each colour. Use flashcards or point to objects in the classroom and ask "He aha te tae?" (What is the colour?). Students respond with the Te Reo Māori name.

### 2. Cultural Significance of Colours in Māori Art

In Māori art and culture, colours are not just decorative; they often carry deep symbolic meanings and connect to whakapapa (genealogy), atua (gods), and the natural world. Understanding these meanings adds another layer to appreciating Māori art.

*   **Whero (Red):** Often represents **mana** (prestige, authority, spiritual power), leadership, and the sacred. It is associated with blood, life, and the earth (Papatūānuku). You see it in carvings, kōwhaiwhai (rafter patterns), and on marae.
*   **Pango (Black):** Represents the underworld, darkness, and the realm of potential being (**Te Pō**). It is associated with the earth, the ancestors, and often used in tā moko (Māori tattooing) and weaving.
*   **Mā (White):** Represents purity, clarity, peace, and the spiritual world. It is associated with light and the heavens (Ranginui).
*   **Kākāriki (Green):** Represents the natural world, growth, fertility, and life. It is seen in the lush landscapes of Aotearoa and in pounamu (greenstone).

**Activity:** Display images of Māori art (e.g., a carved pou, a kōwhaiwhai pattern, a tā moko design). In small groups, ask students to identify the colours used and discuss what cultural meanings those colours might convey based on what they've learned.

### 3. Colours in Everyday Te Reo Māori

Colours are used in everyday language to describe things around us.

*   **He whero te waka.** (The canoe is red.)
*   **He kākāriki te rākau.** (The tree is green.)
*   **He kikorangi te moana.** (The ocean is blue.)

**Activity:** Students describe objects in the classroom or outside using Te Reo Māori colours. (e.g., "He pango te papa.")
