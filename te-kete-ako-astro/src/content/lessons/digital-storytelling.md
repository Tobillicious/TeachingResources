## Summary

This lesson plan introduces students to the exciting world of digital storytelling, combining traditional narrative techniques with modern technology. Students will explore various digital tools (e.g., video, audio, animation, interactive platforms) to create compelling stories, express their cultural narratives, and communicate ideas effectively. The lesson aims to foster creativity, digital literacy, and an appreciation for diverse forms of storytelling, all within a culturally responsive framework for Mangakotukutuku College.

**Resources:**
*   Whiteboard or projector.
*   Markers/pens.
*   Computers/devices with access to digital storytelling tools (e.g., Google Slides/PowerPoint for basic presentations, free video editors like CapCut/DaVinci Resolve, audio recording apps, animation software like Scratch or online tools).
*   Examples of digital stories (e.g., short animated films, digital photo essays, interactive narratives).
*   Handout: "Digital Storytelling Planning Guide" (to be created by ContentCuratorAgent, including a storyboard template).

## Overview

**LEARNING AREA:** Digital Technologies (primary), English (Creative Writing, Media Studies), The Arts (secondary)

**YEAR LEVEL:** Year 9-13

**ACHIEVEMENT OBJECTIVES/TE MATAIAHO LINKS:** Students will understand how digital systems work and their impact on society; apply digital technologies to create and communicate ideas; develop creative writing and media production skills; understand how narratives are constructed and interpreted across different media (NZC Digital Technologies, Progress Outcome 4/5; English, Level 4/5; The Arts, Level 4/5; Te Mataiaho: Te Ao Hangarau - Digital Technologies, Te Ao Reo - Language and Communication, Te Ao Rehua - The Arts).

**KEY COMPETENCIES:** Thinking (designing narratives, problem-solving technical challenges, creative expression), Managing Self (planning digital projects, perseverance in production), Participating and Contributing (collaborative digital storytelling, sharing creations, peer feedback), Using Language, Symbols, and Texts (interpreting digital media, crafting multimodal narratives).

**VALUES:** Whanaungatanga (collaborative digital projects, sharing personal and cultural stories), Manaakitanga (respecting intellectual property in digital media, caring for audience engagement), Whaiora (fostering creativity, self-expression, and enjoyment in digital creation), T큰rangawaewae (creating digital stories about local places, cultural events, or personal histories in Aotearoa, promoting digital preservation of cultural narratives).

**DURATION:** 75 minutes fixed.

**CULTURAL CONSIDERATIONS & ADAPTATIONS:** Encourage students to create digital stories that reflect their cultural identity, family histories, or traditional narratives (e.g., P큰r훮kau, Pasifika myths, refugee experiences); discuss the ethical considerations of using images, music, and stories from diverse cultures in digital projects (e.g., copyright, cultural appropriation); explore how digital tools can be used to revitalize and share indigenous languages and oral traditions; ensure access to diverse digital resources and examples that resonate with students' backgrounds; provide opportunities for students to present their digital stories in a culturally appropriate manner.

## Core Lesson Components

**DO NOW ACTIVITY:** Show a very short (1-2 minute) digital story (e.g., a photo essay with voiceover, a simple animated short). Ask students: "What makes this story engaging? How is it different from a story in a book?" Discuss the elements of digital storytelling. (10 minutes)

**LEARNING INTENTION (WALT):** We are learning to understand the principles of digital storytelling and apply digital tools to create compelling narratives.

**SUCCESS CRITERIA (TIB):** I can identify at least three elements of digital storytelling, plan a short digital story using a storyboard, and use a digital tool to create a basic digital narrative.

**EXIT TICKET:** Students write one idea for a digital story they would like to create and one digital tool they would like to learn more about. (5 minutes)

## Instructions to Teach

Introduce students to the principles of digital storytelling by analyzing diverse examples, guiding them through the planning process using storyboards, and facilitating hands-on creation of short digital narratives using accessible technology, fostering creative expression and digital literacy.

## Lesson Content

### 1. What is Digital Storytelling?

**Digital storytelling** is the art of combining traditional storytelling techniques with digital media. It uses a variety of digital tools (like images, audio, video, text, and animation) to create compelling narratives. It's a powerful way to share ideas, experiences, and cultural knowledge in a modern format.

### 2. Elements of a Digital Story

While every digital story is unique, they often share common elements:

*   **Narrative Arc:** Like traditional stories, digital stories have a beginning, middle, and end, with a clear plot or message.
*   **Voice/Narration:** Often includes a voiceover or written text to guide the audience through the story.
*   **Imagery:** Uses still images, photographs, or video clips to create visual impact and convey meaning.
*   **Music/Sound:** Background music, sound effects, or ambient sounds to set the mood and enhance the emotional impact.
*   **Pacing:** The speed at which the story unfolds, controlled by editing and transitions.
*   **Purpose:** Digital stories can inform, persuade, entertain, or express personal experiences.

### 3. Planning Your Digital Story: The Storyboard

Before you start creating, it's essential to plan your digital story using a **storyboard**. A storyboard is a visual plan that breaks down your story into a sequence of frames or scenes. For each frame, you might include:

*   **Visuals:** What images or video clips will you use?
*   **Audio:** What narration, music, or sound effects will be present?
*   **Text:** Any on-screen text or captions.
*   **Notes:** Ideas for transitions, pacing, or emotional impact.

### 4. Digital Tools for Storytelling

There are many accessible tools you can use:

*   **Presentation Software:** (e.g., Google Slides, PowerPoint) Can be used to create simple animated stories with images and text.
*   **Video Editors:** (e.g., CapCut, DaVinci Resolve, iMovie, Google Photos editor) For combining video clips, images, music, and voiceovers.
*   **Audio Recorders:** (e.g., Voice Memos on phones, Audacity) For recording narration or sound effects.
*   **Animation Software:** (e.g., Scratch, online animation makers) For creating animated characters and scenes.
*   **Interactive Platforms:** (e.g., Twine for text-based games, Scratch for interactive narratives) For stories where the audience makes choices.

### 5. Creative Challenge: My Kura Story

Choose one of the following prompts and create a short (1-2 minute) digital story. Use at least three different digital elements (e.g., images, text, audio).

*   **Prompt A:** Tell a story about a significant event or tradition at Mangakotukutuku College.
*   **Prompt B:** Create a digital narrative about a local hero or a person who has made a positive impact in your community.
*   **Prompt C:** Share a personal story or a family tradition using images and voiceover.
