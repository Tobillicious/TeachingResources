## Summary

This lesson plan introduces students to the systematic approach of the scientific method, guiding them through its key steps from asking questions to drawing conclusions. Through hands-on activities and discussions, students will develop skills in formulating hypotheses, identifying variables, and designing experiments, fostering critical thinking and an appreciation for scientific inquiry in diverse contexts.

**Resources:**
*   Whiteboard or projector.
*   Markers/pens.
*   Simple experiment materials (e.g., different types of seeds, soil, water, measuring cups, pots for a plant growth experiment; or materials for a simple chemical reaction).
*   Worksheet: "Scientific Method Steps: Our Kura Inquiry" (to be created by ContentCuratorAgent, focusing on local or culturally relevant scenarios).
*   Optional: Videos showcasing scientific investigations in New Zealand (e.g., environmental science, agricultural research).

## Overview

**LEARNING AREA:** Science (Nature of Science, Living World, Physical World, Planet Earth and Beyond)

**YEAR LEVEL:** Year 8-10 (adaptable for Year 7-13 with differentiated activities)

**ACHIEVEMENT OBJECTIVES/TE MATAIAHO LINKS:** Students will understand that science is a way of investigating and making sense of the world; develop and use scientific inquiry skills to answer questions; interpret and communicate scientific ideas; understand the importance of evidence in scientific explanations (NZC Science, Level 4/5; Te Mataiaho: Te Ao Tūroa - The Natural World, Te Ao Hangarau - Digital Technologies for data analysis).

**KEY COMPETENCIES:** Thinking (formulating questions, analyzing data, drawing conclusions), Managing Self (planning investigations, systematic approach), Participating and Contributing (collaborative experiment design, sharing findings), Using Language, Symbols, and Texts (interpreting scientific diagrams, communicating scientific ideas).

**VALUES:** Whanaungatanga (collaborative inquiry, respecting diverse perspectives on knowledge), Manaakitanga (caring for the environment during experiments, ethical treatment of living things), Whaiora (fostering curiosity and a love for scientific discovery), Tūrangawaewae (connecting scientific inquiry to local environments, traditional Māori knowledge systems, and community issues).

**DURATION:** 75 minutes fixed.

**CULTURAL CONSIDERATIONS & ADAPTATIONS:** Begin by discussing how Māori have traditionally observed and understood the natural world (e.g., mātauranga Māori, traditional ecological knowledge) as a form of systematic inquiry; use examples of scientific questions relevant to local ecosystems, agriculture, or health challenges in Mangakotukutuku; encourage students to consider how different knowledge systems contribute to our understanding of the world; ensure group work promotes equitable participation from all cultural backgrounds.

## Core Lesson Components

**DO NOW ACTIVITY:** Present students with a puzzling observation (e.g., "Why do leaves change colour in autumn?" or "Why does bread go mouldy?"). Ask: "How could a scientist investigate this?" Discuss their initial ideas, leading into the concept of a systematic approach. (10 minutes)

**LEARNING INTENTION:** To list and describe the steps of the scientific method, formulate a testable hypothesis, identify independent and dependent variables, and understand the importance of controlled experiments.

**SUCCESS CRITERIA:** I can list the main steps of the scientific method, write a testable hypothesis for a given question, identify independent and dependent variables in an experiment, and explain why a control group is important.

**EXIT TICKET:** Students write down one step of the scientific method they found most interesting and one question they would like to investigate using this method. (5 minutes)

## Instructions to Teach

Guide students through the systematic process of the scientific method by defining each step, providing clear examples, facilitating hands-on mini-experiment design, and fostering critical discussion on its application in real-world contexts and its connection to diverse knowledge systems.

## Lesson Content

### 1. What is Science?

Science is a way of investigating and making sense of the natural and physical world. It's not just a collection of facts, but a process of asking questions, gathering evidence, and building explanations. The **Scientific Method** is a systematic approach used by scientists to investigate observations and answer questions reliably.

### 2. Steps of the Scientific Method

1.  **Ask a Question:** Based on an observation, formulate a question that can be investigated. It should be specific and measurable.
    *   *Example:* "Does the amount of sunlight affect the growth rate of kūmara plants?"
2.  **Do Background Research:** Gather information about your topic. What is already known? This helps you form a good hypothesis.
3.  **Construct a Hypothesis:** An educated guess or a testable prediction about the answer to your question. It's usually an "If... then... because..." statement.
    *   *Example:* "If kūmara plants receive more sunlight, then they will grow taller, because sunlight provides energy for photosynthesis."
    *   **Independent Variable:** The factor you *change* or manipulate in the experiment (e.g., amount of sunlight).
    *   **Dependent Variable:** The factor you *measure* or observe that changes in response to the independent variable (e.g., plant height).
4.  **Test with an Experiment:** Design and conduct a fair test to see if your hypothesis is supported. This involves:
    *   **Controlled Variables:** Factors that must remain constant to ensure a fair test (e.g., type of plant, amount of water, type of soil, temperature).
    *   **Control Group:** The group that does *not* receive the treatment or change in the independent variable. It's used for comparison (e.g., kūmara plant with normal sunlight).
    *   **Experimental Group:** The group that receives the treatment or change in the independent variable (e.g., kūmara plant with increased sunlight).
5.  **Analyze Data:** Collect and interpret the results of your experiment. Look for patterns, trends, and relationships in your data.
6.  **Draw a Conclusion:** Determine if your hypothesis was supported or refuted by your data. Explain *why*.
7.  **Communicate Results:** Share your findings with others. This could be through a report, presentation, or discussion.

### 3. Hands-on Activity: Mini-Experiment Design

**Scenario:** Your school wants to reduce its waste. You want to investigate which type of lunch packaging (reusable containers vs. single-use plastic bags) is more common among students.

**Group Work:** In small groups, design a simple investigation using the scientific method to answer this question. Identify:
*   Your investigation question.
*   Your hypothesis.
*   What data you would collect and how.
*   Any variables you would need to control.
*   How you would analyze and communicate your results.

### 4. Discussion & Reflection

*   **Importance:** Why is following the scientific method important for reliable results and avoiding bias in scientific investigations?
*   **Real-world Examples:** How is the scientific method used in everyday life or other fields (e.g., developing new medicines, improving sports performance, understanding climate change)?
