## From Kingdom to Republic

Ancient Rome was not always an empire. It began as a small city-state and was initially ruled by kings. Around 509 BCE, the Romans overthrew their last king, Lucius Tarquinius Superbus, and established a Republic.

## What is a Republic?

A republic is a form of government where citizens have the power to elect leaders to represent them. The Romans were deeply suspicious of any single individual holding too much power.

## Key Institutions

### The Senate
The most powerful body in the Republic. It was a council of elders from Rome's wealthiest families (the patricians). The Senate advised the elected officials, controlled state finances, and directed foreign policy.

### The Consuls
Two consuls were elected each year to serve as the heads of state and commanders of the army. They had equal power, and each could veto the other's decisions.

### The Assemblies
All Roman citizens could participate in assemblies, where they could vote on laws and elect officials.

## SPQR: Senātus Populusque Rōmānus

This famous abbreviation, meaning "The Senate and People of Rome," was the motto of the Republic. It symbolized the idea that power was shared between the aristocratic Senate and the Roman citizens.

## Discussion Points
1.  Why were the Romans so afraid of having a king?
2.  How did the structure of the Republic (e.g., two consuls) prevent one person from becoming too powerful?
3.  What are the similarities and differences between the Roman Republic and our modern form of government?
