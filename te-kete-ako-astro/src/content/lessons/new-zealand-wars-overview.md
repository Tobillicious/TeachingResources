## Introduction

The New Zealand Wars were a series of devastating conflicts that shaped the future of Aotearoa. Fought between the 1840s and 1870s, these wars were not a single, continuous event, but a series of regional conflicts over land, authority, and sovereignty.

## Core Causes

While each conflict had its own specific trigger, the underlying causes were generally consistent:
-   **Disputed Land Sales:** The New Zealand Company and other European settlers were eager to acquire land, often through dubious deals that Māori did not consider valid.
-   **Clashing Cultures:** Pākehā and Māori had fundamentally different understandings of land ownership, law, and authority.
-   **The Treaty of Waitangi:** The differing interpretations of Te Tiriti o Waitangi were a constant source of tension. Māori believed they had retained their "tino rangatiratanga" (chieftainship/sovereignty), while the British believed they had gained full sovereignty.

## Key Conflicts

-   **The Northern War (1845-46):** Sparked by Hōne Heke cutting down the British flagstaff at Kororāreka, a symbol of his protest against the loss of Māori authority.
-   **The Waikato War (1863-64):** The largest and most significant conflict, involving a full-scale British invasion of the Waikato region, the heartland of the Kīngitanga (Māori King Movement). This resulted in massive land confiscations (raupatu).
-   **The Wars of Tītokowaru and Te Kooti (1868-72):** These later conflicts were characterized by brilliant guerrilla tactics led by charismatic Māori prophets and military leaders.

## Consequences

The wars had a devastating impact on Māori society, leading to significant loss of life, the confiscation of millions of acres of land, and the erosion of Māori political and economic autonomy. The legacy of these conflicts continues to shape New Zealand today.
