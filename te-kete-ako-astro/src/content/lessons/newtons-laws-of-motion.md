## Introduction

Sir Isaac Newton's three laws of motion describe the relationship between an object and the forces acting upon it. These laws are the foundation of classical mechanics.

## First Law: The Law of Inertia
> An object at rest stays at rest and an object in motion stays in motion with the same speed and in the same direction unless acted upon by an unbalanced force.

In simple terms, things keep doing what they are already doing. If an object is still, it will stay still. If it's moving, it will keep moving. This property of matter to resist changes in its state of motion is called **inertia**.

## Second Law: F = ma
> The acceleration of an object is directly proportional to the net force acting upon it and inversely proportional to its mass.

This law is often written as the famous equation: **Force = mass Ã— acceleration (F=ma)**.

This means:
- If you push an object harder (more force), it will accelerate more.
- If an object has more mass (it's heavier), it will take more force to accelerate it.

## Third Law: Action and Reaction
> For every action, there is an equal and opposite reaction.

This means that for every force, there is a reaction force that is equal in size, but opposite in direction. Whenever an object pushes another object, it gets pushed back in the opposite direction equally hard.

**Example:** When you jump, your legs apply a force to the ground, and the ground applies an equal and opposite reaction force that propels you into the air.

## Activity

In small groups, come up with a real-world example for each of Newton's three laws and be prepared to demonstrate or explain it to the class.
