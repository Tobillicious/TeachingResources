## Summary

This lesson plan guides students through a critical exploration of the ethical issues surrounding AI-generated art. It uses a reading comprehension text to introduce concepts of authorship, copyright, and the definition of creativity in the age of artificial intelligence, encouraging students to develop and articulate their own informed viewpoints on these complex and evolving topics.

*   Optional: Short video clips or news articles discussing the AI art debate in New Zealand or globally.

## Overview

**LEARNING AREA:** Digital Technologies (primary), The Arts, Social Sciences (secondary)

**YEAR LEVEL:** Year 10-13

**ACHIEVEMENT OBJECTIVES/TE MATAIAHO LINKS:** Students will understand how digital systems work and their impact on society; explore the ethical considerations of emerging technologies; analyze and interpret artistic works; develop critical thinking skills to evaluate complex issues and form reasoned arguments (NZC Digital Technologies, Progress Outcome 4/5; The Arts, Level 5; Social Sciences, Level 5; Te Mataiaho: Te Ao Hangarau - Digital Technologies, Te Ao Tangata - Social Sciences, Te Ao Rehua - The Arts).

**KEY COMPETENCIES:** Thinking (critically evaluating information, forming reasoned arguments, ethical reasoning), Managing Self (developing informed opinions, engaging with complex ideas), Participating and Contributing (engaging in respectful ethical discussions, understanding diverse perspectives), Using Language, Symbols, and Texts (interpreting artistic and technical information, articulating ideas).

**VALUES:** Whanaungatanga (building respectful relationships through ethical discussion, understanding diverse perspectives on creativity and ownership), Manaakitanga (caring for artists and their intellectual property, considering the impact of AI on livelihoods), Whaiora (fostering creativity and innovation responsibly), Tūrangawaewae (discussing the intellectual property of Māori and Pasifika art forms, and the potential for cultural appropriation in AI-generated content).

**DURATION:** 75 minutes fixed.

**CULTURAL CONSIDERATIONS & ADAPTATIONS:** Discuss the concept of intellectual property and cultural appropriation in relation to Māori and Pasifika art forms (e.g., kōwhaiwhai, tā moko, weaving patterns) and how AI might misuse or misrepresent them; explore the idea of authorship and creativity from diverse cultural perspectives, including indigenous views on collective ownership of knowledge and art; encourage students to consider how AI art might impact traditional artists and cultural practices within their own communities; ensure discussions are inclusive and respectful of all viewpoints.

## Core Lesson Components

**DO NOW ACTIVITY:** Display a few AI-generated images alongside human-created art (without revealing which is which). Ask students: "Which of these do you consider 'art'? Why or why not? What makes something 'art'?" Facilitate a brief class discussion. (10 minutes)

**LEARNING INTENTION:** To understand the key ethical issues surrounding AI art, including questions of copyright, creativity, and societal impact.

**SUCCESS CRITERIA:** I can define AI art and identify at least three ethical concerns related to its creation and use, and explain my viewpoint on at least one of these concerns.

**EXIT TICKET:** Students write down one ethical concern about AI art that they find most significant and briefly explain why it matters to them, or suggest one rule they think should apply to AI art. (5 minutes)

## Instructions to Teach

Facilitate a critical inquiry into the ethical landscape of AI-generated art by engaging students in text analysis, guiding discussions on copyright, authorship, and societal impact, and empowering them to articulate informed viewpoints on these complex and evolving issues.

### 1. Reading Comprehension: The AI Art Debate

## Can a Machine Be an Artist?

In 2022, a new wave of Artificial Intelligence (AI) tools emerged that could generate stunningly detailed images from simple text prompts. Users could type "a photorealistic astronaut riding a horse on Mars" and receive a unique, complex image in seconds. These AI art generators, such as Midjourney and DALL-E 2, have sparked a fierce debate in the art world. Proponents hail them as revolutionary tools for creativity, allowing anyone to visualise their ideas, regardless of their technical drawing skill. They argue that AI is simply a new paintbrush, a sophisticated instrument that opens up new artistic possibilities.

However, many human artists and designers are deeply concerned. A major point of contention is how these AI models are trained. They learn by analysing vast datasets containing millions of images scraped from the internet, many of which are copyrighted works by human artists. These artists argue that the AI is essentially "copying" their style and labour without their consent or compensation. For example, an AI can be prompted to create an image "in the style of Weta Workshop" or "like a Rita Angus painting," raising complex questions about artistic ownership and copyright law.

The central question is whether AI-generated images can truly be considered "art." Does art require intention, emotion, and lived experience, or is it purely about the final product? If an AI cannot feel joy or sorrow, can it create a genuinely joyful or sorrowful image? This debate challenges our very definition of creativity. As this technology becomes more sophisticated, it forces us to consider what we value most in art: the aesthetic beauty of the image itself, or the human story and skill behind its creation. There are no easy answers, and the conversation is set to reshape our understanding of art for years to come.

### Comprehension & Critical Thinking Questions

1.  **What is the main argument in favour of AI art generators, according to the text?**
    *   A) They are a faster way to copy existing famous paintings.
    *   B) They are a new tool that can help anyone be creative.
    *   C) They will make human artists obsolete.
    *   D) They are only used for creating photorealistic images.

2.  **What is the primary concern that human artists have about how AI models are trained?**
    *   A) The AI models are not powerful enough to learn properly.
    *   B) The AI uses too much electricity during training.
    *   C) The AI learns from their copyrighted work without permission.
    *   D) The AI can only generate images in one specific style.

3.  **The text asks if art requires "intention, emotion, and lived experience." What is the best synonym for "intention" in this context?**
    *   A) An accident
    *   B) A purpose or a plan
    *   C) A beautiful outcome
    *   D) A technical skill

4.  **(Critical Thinking) The text compares an AI art generator to "a new paintbrush." Do you think this is a fair comparison? Explain why or why not.**

5.  **(Critical Thinking) Who do you think should own the copyright to an image created by an AI: the person who wrote the prompt, the company that created the AI, or the artists whose work was used in the training data? Justify your choice.**
