## Summary

This lesson plan offers an interdisciplinary exploration of Kī-o-Rahi, the traditional Māori sport, through the lens of physics. Students will learn about the rules and cultural significance of Kī-o-Rahi while investigating fundamental physics concepts such as force, motion, and energy as applied in the game. The lesson aims to foster cultural understanding, promote physical activity, and connect scientific principles to a dynamic, culturally rich context, all within a culturally responsive framework for Mangakotukutuku College.

**Resources:**
*   Whiteboard or projector.
*   Markers/pens.
*   Video clips of Kī-o-Rahi being played (e.g., YouTube tutorials, game highlights).
*   Kī-o-Rahi equipment (if available, or diagrams/images of the playing field and kī).
*   Handout: "Kī-o-Rahi Rules & Physics Principles" (to be created by ContentCuratorAgent, including diagrams).
*   Optional: Materials for a simple experiment demonstrating force and motion (e.g., toy cars, ramps, measuring tape).

## Overview

**LEARNING AREA:** Science (Physical World), Health and Physical Education (Movement Concepts and Motor Skills), Social Sciences (Culture and Heritage)

**YEAR LEVEL:** Year 9-11 (adaptable for Year 7-13 with differentiated complexity)

**ACHIEVEMENT OBJECTIVES/TE MATAIAHO LINKS:** Students will understand how forces affect motion; explore energy transformations in physical activity; understand and appreciate Māori culture and heritage through physical activity; develop movement skills and apply strategic thinking (NZC Science, Level 4/5; Health and Physical Education, Level 4/5; Social Sciences, Level 4/5; Te Mataiaho: Te Ao Tūroa - The Natural World, Te Ao Tangata - Social Sciences, Te Ao Hākinakina - Health and Physical Education).

**KEY COMPETENCIES:** Thinking (analyzing game strategies, applying scientific principles, problem-solving), Managing Self (participating in physical activity, self-regulation), Participating and Contributing (teamwork, fair play, respecting cultural practices), Using Language, Symbols, and Texts (interpreting game rules, understanding scientific diagrams).

**VALUES:** Whanaungatanga (teamwork, fair play, building positive relationships through sport), Manaakitanga (showing respect for cultural practices and opponents), Whaiora (promoting physical and mental well-being through active participation), Tūrangawaewae (connecting to Māori cultural heritage through traditional sport, understanding the significance of Kī-o-Rahi in Aotearoa).

**DURATION:** 75 minutes fixed.

**CULTURAL CONSIDERATIONS & ADAPTATIONS:** Begin by acknowledging the origins of Kī-o-Rahi as a traditional Māori sport, emphasizing its cultural significance and tikanga (customs); use Te Reo Māori terminology for game elements (e.g., kī, tupu, pou, taonga); encourage students to share any prior knowledge or experiences with Kī-o-Rahi or other traditional Māori/Pasifika games; discuss how traditional knowledge systems often incorporate scientific principles; ensure the lesson promotes active participation and respect for all students' physical abilities and cultural backgrounds.

## Core Lesson Components

**DO NOW ACTIVITY:** Show a short video clip of Kī-o-Rahi being played. Ask students: "What do you notice about this game? What skills do you think are important?" Discuss their initial observations. (10 minutes)

**LEARNING INTENTION (WALT):** We are learning to understand the basic rules and cultural significance of Kī-o-Rahi, and to identify and explain the physics principles (force, motion, energy) at play within the game.

**SUCCESS CRITERIA (TIB):** I can describe the objective of Kī-o-Rahi, name at least two physics principles demonstrated in the game, and provide an example of how a physics principle is applied in a Kī-o-Rahi action (e.g., throwing the kī).

**EXIT TICKET:** Students write one thing they found interesting about Kī-o-Rahi and one physics concept they observed in the game. (5 minutes)

## Instructions to Teach

Introduce students to the traditional Māori sport of Kī-o-Rahi, explaining its rules and cultural significance, then guide them through an analysis of the game's actions to identify and explain fundamental physics principles such as force, motion, and energy, fostering interdisciplinary understanding and cultural appreciation.

## Lesson Content

### 1. Introduction to Kī-o-Rahi

**Kī-o-Rahi** is a traditional Māori team sport played on a circular field. It is a fast-paced, strategic game that combines elements of tag, rugby, and handball. More than just a game, Kī-o-Rahi is a **taonga** (treasure) that embodies Māori values such as teamwork, respect, and strategic thinking.

**Basic Objective:** One team (Kīoma) tries to score points by touching the **tupu** (central target) with the **kī** (ball) and by running around the **pou** (boundary markers). The other team (Taniwha) tries to prevent this by tagging Kīoma players and by scoring points by hitting the kī into the **pou**.

### 2. Physics in Kī-o-Rahi: Force, Motion, and Energy

Every action in Kī-o-Rahi involves physics! Let's look at some key principles:

*   **Force:** A push or a pull that can change an object's motion. In Kī-o-Rahi, forces are constantly at play.
    *   *Example:* When a player throws the kī, they apply a **force** to it, causing it to move.
    *   *Example:* When a player tags an opponent, they apply a **force** to stop their motion.

*   **Motion:** The change in position of an object over time. Objects can move in straight lines, curves, or change speed.
    *   *Example:* The **motion** of the kī as it flies through the air after being thrown.
    *   *Example:* The **motion** of players running across the field.

*   **Energy:** The ability to do work or cause change. In Kī-o-Rahi, players use and transfer different forms of energy.
    *   **Kinetic Energy:** The energy of motion. A running player or a flying kī has kinetic energy.
    *   **Potential Energy:** Stored energy due to position or state. A player about to jump has gravitational potential energy.
    *   *Example:* When a player runs, their chemical energy (from food) is converted into **kinetic energy**.
    *   *Example:* When the kī is thrown high into the air, it gains **potential energy** as it rises, which then converts back to **kinetic energy** as it falls.

### 3. Applying Physics to Game Actions

Let's analyze some specific actions in Kī-o-Rahi:

*   **Throwing the Kī:**
    *   **Force:** The player applies force to the kī.
    *   **Motion:** The kī accelerates and follows a parabolic (curved) path due to the initial force and gravity.
    *   **Energy:** Chemical energy from the player converts to kinetic energy of the kī.

*   **Running and Changing Direction:**
    *   **Force:** Players apply force against the ground to propel themselves forward. Friction provides the necessary grip.
    *   **Motion:** Players constantly change speed and direction, demonstrating acceleration and deceleration.
    *   **Energy:** Kinetic energy is used and transformed as players move.

*   **Hitting the Tupu/Pou:**
    *   **Force:** The kī exerts a force on the tupu or pou upon impact.
    *   **Motion:** The tupu or pou might move or vibrate due to the impact.
    *   **Energy:** Kinetic energy of the kī is transferred to the tupu/pou and converted into sound and heat energy.

### 4. Discussion & Reflection

*   How does understanding physics help a Kī-o-Rahi player improve their game strategy (e.g., how to throw the kī further, how to run more efficiently)?
*   What other sports or physical activities can you think of where physics principles are clearly demonstrated?
*   How does learning about Kī-o-Rahi connect you to Māori culture and history?
