## What Are the Elements of Art?

The Elements of Art are the fundamental building blocks that artists use to create any work of art. Think of them like the ingredients in a recipe. By understanding and using these seven elements, you can learn to analyze art and create your own compelling compositions.

### 1. Line
A line is a mark made on a surface. It can be straight, curved, thick, thin, or jagged. Lines can be used to create outlines, suggest movement, or lead the viewer's eye.

### 2. Shape
A shape is a two-dimensional area enclosed by a line. Shapes can be **geometric** (like squares and circles) or **organic** (like leaves and clouds).

### 3. Form
Form is a three-dimensional object that has height, width, and depth. A square is a shape, but a cube is a form.

### 4. Space
Space refers to the area around, between, or within things. **Positive space** is the area taken up by the subject, while **negative space** is the area around it.

### 5. Texture
Texture is the surface quality of an object. It's how something feels or looks like it would feel. It can be rough, smooth, bumpy, or soft.

### 6. Value
Value refers to the lightness or darkness of a color. A full range of values, from bright white to dark black, can create a sense of depth and realism.

### 7. Color
Color is what we see when light reflects off an object. It has three main properties: **hue** (the name of the color, e.g., red), **intensity** (the brightness or dullness), and **value** (the lightness or darkness).

## Activity: Element Scavenger Hunt

Look around the classroom or outside. Find and sketch an example of each of the seven elements of art. For example:
- **Line:** The edge of a desk.
- **Shape:** A circular clock.
- **Form:** A cylindrical water bottle.
