## Introduction: What is a Sonnet?

A sonnet is a fourteen-line poem with a specific rhyme scheme. The Shakespearean sonnet, also known as the English sonnet, has a structure that is particularly well-suited to developing a question or argument.

## The Structure

A Shakespearean sonnet is composed of:
- **Three Quatrains:** Four-line stanzas that build upon each other.
- **One Couplet:** A two-line stanza at the end that usually provides a conclusion or a twist.

The rhyme scheme is always **ABAB CDCD EFEF GG**.

## Iambic Pentameter

Shakespearean sonnets are written in iambic pentameter. This means each line has ten syllables, alternating between unstressed and stressed beats, creating a natural rhythm.

**Example:** "Shall **I** com**pare** thee **to** a **sum**mer's **day**?" (Sonnet 18)

## The "Turn"

The "turn," or *volta*, is a shift in thought or argument. In a Shakespearean sonnet, the turn often occurs in the third quatrain or in the final couplet.

## Activity: Analyze Sonnet 130

Read Shakespeare's Sonnet 130 ("My mistress' eyes are nothing like the sun"). In groups, identify:
1.  The rhyme scheme.
2.  Examples of iambic pentameter.
3.  The main argument of the three quatrains.
4.  How the final couplet provides a "turn" and a surprising conclusion.

## Extension

Try writing your own four-line quatrain in iambic pentameter with an ABAB rhyme scheme.
