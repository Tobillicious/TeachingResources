## Summary

This lesson plan introduces students to core economic principles such as scarcity, supply, demand, and different economic systems. Through interactive discussions and practical examples, students will explore how these concepts influence daily life and societal decisions, with a particular emphasis on their relevance within the diverse cultural and economic landscape of Aotearoa New Zealand.

**Resources:**
*   Whiteboard or projector.
*   Markers/pens.
*   Examples of goods and services (e.g., pictures of local produce, crafts, services offered in the community).
*   Worksheet: "Economic Choices in Our Community" (to be created by ContentCuratorAgent, focusing on local scenarios).
*   Optional: Short video clips explaining economic concepts using New Zealand examples (e.g., dairy industry, tourism, local markets).

## Overview

**LEARNING AREA:** Social Sciences (Economics)

**YEAR LEVEL:** Year 8-10 (adaptable for Year 7-13 with differentiated activities)

**ACHIEVEMENT OBJECTIVES/TE MATAIAHO LINKS:** Students will understand how economic decisions are made in response to scarcity; analyze the interaction of supply and demand in various contexts; identify and compare different economic systems and their implications for individuals and communities (NZC Social Sciences, Level 4/5; Te Mataiaho: Te Ao Tangata - Social Sciences, Te Ao Hangarau - Digital Technologies for data analysis).

**KEY COMPETENCIES:** Thinking (understanding complex systems, analyzing cause and effect, making informed decisions), Managing Self (considering personal economic choices), Participating and Contributing (engaging in economic discussions, understanding community resource allocation), Using Language, Symbols, and Texts (interpreting economic data and terminology).

**VALUES:** Whanaungatanga (understanding how economic decisions impact community well-being and relationships), Manaakitanga (considering equitable distribution of resources and support for vulnerable groups), Whaiora (promoting sustainable economic practices for collective well-being), Tūrangawaewae (connecting economic concepts to local land, resources, and cultural practices).

**DURATION:** 75 minutes fixed.

**CULTURAL CONSIDERATIONS & ADAPTATIONS:** Begin by exploring traditional Māori economic practices (e.g., kaitiakitanga in resource management, gifting, communal resource sharing) to provide a culturally relevant foundation for understanding scarcity and allocation; use examples of local businesses, community initiatives, or historical events in Aotearoa (e.g., impact of land sales, development of specific industries) when discussing supply, demand, and economic systems; encourage students to analyze economic challenges and opportunities within their own whānau and community contexts, fostering critical thinking about equity and sustainability.

## Core Lesson Components

**DO NOW ACTIVITY:** Present students with a scenario: "Our school has received a limited budget for new sports equipment. What equipment should we buy, and why?" Discuss their choices, highlighting the concept of limited resources and competing desires. (10 minutes)

**LEARNING INTENTION:** To define economics and the concept of scarcity, explain the basic principles of supply and demand, identify different types of economic systems, and understand the role of choices and opportunity cost in economics.

**SUCCESS CRITERIA:** I can define scarcity and opportunity cost, explain how supply and demand interact using an example, identify characteristics of at least two economic systems, and apply economic concepts to a real-world scenario.

**EXIT TICKET:** Students write one sentence defining opportunity cost and provide a personal example of it from their day. (5 minutes)

## Instructions to Teach

Facilitate an engaging exploration of fundamental economic concepts by initiating discussions on scarcity and choice, guiding students through interactive activities to model supply and demand, and critically examining diverse economic systems through the lens of Aotearoa New Zealand's unique cultural and historical context.

## Lesson Content

### What is Economics?

Economics is the study of how societies allocate **scarce resources** to satisfy **unlimited wants and needs**. It's about making choices when you can't have everything you want.

*   **Scarcity:** This is the fundamental economic problem – resources (like time, money, natural resources) are limited, but human desires are not. Because of scarcity, we always have to make choices.
*   **Choices and Opportunity Cost:** Every choice we make means giving up something else. The **opportunity cost** is the value of the next best alternative that you *didn't* choose.
    *   *Example:* If you choose to spend your allowance on a new book, the opportunity cost might be the movie ticket you could have bought instead.

### Supply and Demand

These are two of the most important forces in a market economy. They determine prices and quantities of goods and services.

*   **Demand:** The quantity of a good or service that consumers are willing and able to purchase at various prices.
    *   **Law of Demand:** As the price of a good increases, the quantity demanded by consumers generally decreases (and vice versa). People buy less when things are expensive.
*   **Supply:** The quantity of a good or service that producers are willing and able to offer for sale at various prices.
    *   **Law of Supply:** As the price of a good increases, the quantity supplied by producers generally increases (and vice versa). Producers want to sell more when they can get a higher price.
*   **Equilibrium:** The point where supply and demand meet. At this price, the quantity of a good or service supplied is equal to the quantity demanded.

### Economic Systems

Different societies organize their economies in different ways to answer three basic questions: What to produce? How to produce it? For whom to produce it?

*   **Traditional Economy:** Decisions are based on customs, traditions, and historical practices. Often found in small, rural communities. (e.g., some historical Māori economic practices focused on communal well-being and sustainable resource use).
*   **Command Economy (Planned Economy):** The government makes most or all economic decisions. (e.g., North Korea, Cuba).
*   **Market Economy (Free Market):** Economic decisions are made by individuals and businesses, driven by supply and demand, with minimal government interference. (e.g., theoretical pure capitalism).
*   **Mixed Economy:** A blend of market and command elements. Both private businesses and the government play significant roles in the economy. Most modern countries, including New Zealand, have mixed economies.

### Real-World Connections

Economic concepts are everywhere! Think about:

*   **Buying decisions:** Why do you choose one product over another?
*   **News about inflation:** What does it mean when prices go up?
*   **Government policies:** How do government decisions about taxes or spending affect people?
*   **Local businesses:** How do they decide what to sell and at what price?
