Students will learn about the Matariki star cluster, associated traditions like remembrance and planning for the future, and its importance in the Māori maramataka (lunar calendar). The lesson aims to foster cultural understanding, promote Te Reo Māori, and connect scientific concepts to indigenous knowledge systems, all within a culturally responsive framework for Mangakotukutuku College.

**Resources:**

## Lesson Content

### 1. What is Matariki?

**Matariki** is the Māori name for the Pleiades star cluster. For Māori, the appearance of Matariki in the dawn sky in late May or early June signals the start of the Māori New Year. It is a very important time in the **maramataka** (Māori lunar calendar).

### 2. The Matariki Star Cluster (Ngā Whetū o Matariki)

Matariki is a cluster of stars, and traditionally, nine stars are often associated with it, each with a specific meaning. While some iwi (tribes) observe Puanga (Rigel star) as their New Year marker, Matariki is widely celebrated.

*   **Matariki (Alcyone):** The mother, associated with well-being and health.
*   **Tupu-ā-nuku (Atlas):** Associated with food grown in the ground.
*   **Tupu-ā-rangi (Pleione):** Associated with food from the sky (birds, fruits).
*   **Waitī (Maia):** Associated with fresh water and food from fresh water.
*   **Waitā (Taygeta):** Associated with the ocean and food from the ocean.
*   **Waipuna-ā-rangi (Electra):** Associated with rain.
*   **Ururangi (Merope):** Associated with the winds.
*   **Pōhutukawa (Celaeno):** Associated with those who have passed away.
*   **Hiwa-i-te-rangi (Sterope):** Associated with aspirations for the new year, granting wishes.

### 3. Traditions of Matariki

Matariki is a time for:

*   **Remembrance (Whakamaharatanga):** A time to remember those who have passed away in the last year. The star Pōhutukawa is particularly linked to this.
*   **Celebrating the Present (Whakanui):** A time for whānau (family) and friends to come together, share kai (food), and celebrate.
*   **Planning for the Future (Whakamanawa):** A time to reflect on the past year, set goals, and make plans for the year ahead. The star Hiwa-i-te-rangi is linked to aspirations.
*   **Giving Thanks (Whakawhetai):** A time to acknowledge the harvest and the bounty of the land and sea.

### 4. Matariki and the Maramataka

The maramataka is the Māori lunar calendar, which guides traditional activities like planting, fishing, and harvesting. The appearance of Matariki signals the start of a new cycle, influencing these activities.

### 5. Matariki Today

Matariki is now a public holiday in New Zealand, a time for all New Zealanders to learn about and celebrate Māori culture, history, and traditions. It's an opportunity to connect with the land, the sky, and each other.
