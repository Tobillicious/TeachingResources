## The First Motion Pictures

The late 19th century saw a flurry of inventions that made motion pictures possible. In 1891, **Thomas Edison's** company invented the **Kinetoscope**, a device that allowed one person at a time to view a short, moving picture through a peephole.

However, the birth of cinema as a shared, public experience is credited to the **Lumière brothers**, Auguste and Louis, in France. In **1895**, they held the first public screening of their films, using a device they called the **Cinématographe**, which could both record and project motion pictures. Their early films were simple "actualities," like a train arriving at a station or workers leaving a factory.

## The Rise of Narrative Film

Early filmmakers quickly realized that they could do more than just record reality; they could tell stories.
-   **Georges Méliès:** A French illusionist who is considered the father of special effects. His most famous film, *A Trip to the Moon* (1902), used innovative techniques like stop-motion and multiple exposures to create a fantastical narrative.
-   **Edwin S. Porter:** An American director who developed key storytelling techniques. His 1903 film, *The Great Train Robbery*, is a landmark in cinema history for its use of cross-cutting to show simultaneous action in different locations.

## The Silent Era

From the 1890s until the late 1920s, films were silent. They were often accompanied by live music, such as a pianist or an organist, and dialogue was presented on **intertitles** (cards with text shown between scenes). This era saw the rise of the first movie stars, like **Charlie Chaplin**, and the development of sophisticated visual storytelling techniques.

## The Arrival of Sound

In **1927**, *The Jazz Singer* was released. It was the first feature-length film to include synchronized dialogue, and it marked the beginning of the end for the silent era. The "talkies" were a sensation, and by the early 1930s, silent films were a thing of the past.
