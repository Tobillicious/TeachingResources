## What was the Renaissance?

The Renaissance (a French word meaning "rebirth") was a period in European history, from the 14th to the 17th century, that marked the transition from the Middle Ages to modernity. It was characterized by a renewed interest in the art, literature, and philosophy of ancient Greece and Rome.

## Humanism: A New Way of Thinking

The intellectual basis of the Renaissance was **humanism**, a philosophy that emphasized the potential and achievements of human beings. Humanist thinkers studied classical texts and focused on subjects like history, literature, and philosophy, which are now known as the humanities.

## Key Figures of the Renaissance

### Art
The Renaissance produced some of the greatest artists in history, who created works of incredible realism and emotional depth.
-   **Leonardo da Vinci:** A true "Renaissance man," he was a painter, sculptor, architect, musician, scientist, inventor, and more. His most famous works include the *Mona Lisa* and *The Last Supper*.
-   **Michelangelo:** A master sculptor and painter, famous for his statue of *David* and the ceiling of the Sistine Chapel in Rome.

### Science
The Renaissance also saw major advances in science, as thinkers began to question traditional beliefs and rely on observation and experimentation.
-   **Nicolaus Copernicus:** An astronomer who proposed a **heliocentric** model of the universe, with the Sun at the center, challenging the long-held belief that the Earth was the center.
-   **Galileo Galilei:** An astronomer and physicist who used the telescope to make groundbreaking observations that supported Copernicus's theory.

## The Impact of the Printing Press

The invention of the printing press by **Johannes Gutenberg** around 1440 was a revolutionary development. It allowed for the mass production of books, making knowledge more accessible than ever before and fueling the spread of Renaissance ideas.
