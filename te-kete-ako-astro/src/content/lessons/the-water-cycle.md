## Introduction

Where does rain come from? Why do puddles disappear on a sunny day? The answer to both questions is the water cycle! The water cycle is the continuous movement of water on, above, and below the surface of the Earth.

## The Four Main Stages

The water cycle is a constant journey with four main stops.

### 1. Evaporation
This is when the sun heats up water in rivers, lakes, or the ocean and turns it into vapor or steam. The water vapor rises into the air.
- **Activity:** Place a shallow dish of water in a sunny spot. Observe it over a few hours. What happens to the water?

### 2. Condensation
As the water vapor rises, it gets cold. This causes it to change back into tiny liquid water droplets, forming clouds.
- **Activity:** Observe the outside of a glass of ice water. Where do the water droplets come from?

### 3. Precipitation
When so much water has condensed that the air cannot hold it anymore, the clouds get heavy. The water falls back to the Earth in the form of rain, hail, sleet, or snow.

### 4. Collection
When water falls back to Earth, it may fall into oceans, lakes, or rivers. It may also end up on land. Some of it soaks into the earth and becomes part of the "groundwater" that plants and animals use to drink. The rest flows over the soil and collects in rivers, lakes, and oceans, starting the cycle all over again.

## Diagram of the Water Cycle

*(A simple diagram showing the sun, a body of water, an arrow up for evaporation, a cloud for condensation, rain for precipitation, and an arrow back to the water for collection would be drawn here by the students.)*

## Key Questions
1. What is the energy source that drives the water cycle?
2. Can you think of an example of condensation you have seen in your own home?
3. Why is the water cycle important for life on Earth?
