## What is DNA?

Deoxyribonucleic acid, or DNA, is a molecule that contains the unique genetic code for every living thing. It's like a blueprint or a recipe that holds the instructions for building and maintaining an organism.

## The Double Helix

The structure of DNA is a **double helix**, which looks like a twisted ladder.
-   The two sides of the ladder are made of alternating sugar and phosphate molecules.
-   The "rungs" of the ladder are made of pairs of four chemical bases.

## The Four Bases

There are four chemical bases in DNA:
-   **Adenine (A)**
-   **Guanine (G)**
-   **Cytosine (C)**
-   **Thymine (T)**

These bases always pair up in a specific way:
-   **A** always pairs with **T**.
-   **C** always pairs with **G**.

This is known as the **base-pairing rule**. The sequence of these bases along the DNA molecule is what creates the genetic code.

## Genes and Chromosomes

-   A **gene** is a specific segment of DNA that contains the instructions for building one particular protein. Proteins are the molecules that do most of the work in our cells.
-   DNA is tightly coiled and packaged into structures called **chromosomes**, which are found inside the nucleus of every cell. Humans have 23 pairs of chromosomes.

## DNA Replication

DNA replication is the process by which a cell makes an identical copy of its DNA. This is essential for cell division, growth, and repair. The double helix "unzips," and each side serves as a template for a new, complementary strand.

## Activity: Build a DNA Model
Using different colored candies or beads, create a simple model of a DNA double helix. Make sure to follow the base-pairing rule (A with T, C with G).
