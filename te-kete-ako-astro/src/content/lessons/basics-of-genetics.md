## What is Genetics?

Genetics is the study of **heredity**, which is how traits are passed down from parents to their offspring.

## Gregor Mendel: The Father of Genetics

The basic principles of genetics were discovered by a monk named **Gregor Mendel** in the 1860s. By experimenting with pea plants, he was able to show that traits are passed down in a predictable way.

## Key Concepts

### Genes and Alleles
-   A **gene** is a segment of DNA that codes for a specific trait (e.g., eye color).
-   **Alleles** are different versions of the same gene. For example, the gene for eye color has alleles for blue eyes, brown eyes, etc.

For each gene, you inherit two alleles: one from your mother and one from your father.

### Dominant and Recessive Alleles
-   A **dominant** allele is one that will always be expressed if it is present. It is represented by a capital letter (e.g., B for brown eyes).
-   A **recessive** allele is one that will only be expressed if two copies of it are present. It is represented by a lowercase letter (e.g., b for blue eyes).

### Genotype and Phenotype
-   **Genotype:** The genetic makeup of an organism (the combination of alleles). For example, BB, Bb, or bb.
-   **Phenotype:** The physical expression of the genotype (what the organism looks like). For example, brown eyes or blue eyes.

-   **Homozygous:** Having two identical alleles for a trait (e.g., BB or bb).
-   **Heterozygous:** Having two different alleles for a trait (e.g., Bb).

## Punnett Squares

A Punnett square is a simple diagram that is used to predict the outcome of a particular cross or breeding experiment.

**Example:** A cross between two heterozygous parents (Bb).

| | B | b |
| :--- | :-: | :-: |
| **B** | BB | Bb |
| **b** | Bb | bb |

From this Punnett square, we can predict that there is a:
-   75% chance the offspring will have brown eyes (BB or Bb).
-   25% chance the offspring will have blue eyes (bb).

## Activity
In pairs, use a Punnett square to predict the outcome of a cross between a homozygous dominant parent (BB) and a heterozygous parent (Bb). What are the possible genotypes and phenotypes of the offspring?
