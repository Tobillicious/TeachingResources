## Introduction

World War I (1914-1918) was a global conflict of a scale never seen before. While the assassination of Archduke Franz Ferdinand of Austria-Hungary was the immediate trigger, the war was the result of long-simmering tensions in Europe. We can remember these with the acronym **M.A.I.N.**

## M: Militarism
This is the belief that a country should maintain a strong military capability and be prepared to use it aggressively to defend or promote national interests. In the early 20th century, European powers like Britain and Germany were locked in an **arms race**, particularly in building powerful navies. This created an atmosphere of suspicion and fear.

## A: Alliances
A complex web of alliances developed in Europe, creating two main power blocs. The idea was to provide mutual protection, but it meant that a small conflict could quickly escalate into a continent-wide war.
-   **The Triple Alliance:** Germany, Austria-Hungary, and Italy.
-   **The Triple Entente:** France, Russia, and Great Britain.

## I: Imperialism
Imperialism is when a country extends its power and influence through colonization, use of military force, or other means. European powers were competing for colonies and resources around the world, particularly in Africa and Asia. This competition led to rivalries and confrontations.

## N: Nationalism
Nationalism is an intense form of patriotism or loyalty to one's country. While it can be a force for unity, it can also be aggressive and exclusionary. In the Balkans, a region of many different ethnic groups, Slavic nationalism (encouraged by Russia) was a direct threat to the Austro-Hungarian Empire.

## The Spark: Assassination in Sarajevo
On **June 28, 1914**, Archduke Franz Ferdinand, the heir to the Austro-Hungarian throne, was assassinated in Sarajevo by Gavrilo Princip, a Serbian nationalist. This event triggered the alliance system, and within weeks, all of Europe was at war.

## Activity
In groups, create a mind map for one of the four M.A.I.N. causes. Explain how it contributed to the outbreak of war and find one specific historical example.
