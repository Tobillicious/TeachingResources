## Summary

This lesson plan introduces students to the foundational concepts of Python programming, focusing on its readability, versatility, and practical applications. Through interactive activities and culturally relevant examples, students will write and execute their first Python program, understand variables, and perform basic arithmetic, fostering computational thinking and digital literacy.

**Resources:**
*   Computers with Python installed (or access to an online Python interpreter like Replit or Google Colab).
*   Whiteboard or projector.
*   Markers/pens.
*   Handout: "Python Basics Practice" (to be created by ContentCuratorAgent, focusing on local examples).
*   Optional: Video showcasing Python applications in areas relevant to students' interests (e.g., game development, animation).

## Overview

**LEARNING AREA:** Digital Technologies

**YEAR LEVEL:** Year 7-9 (adaptable for Year 10-13 with extended challenges)

**ACHIEVEMENT OBJECTIVES/TE MATAIAHO LINKS:** Students will understand basic programming concepts and apply them to create simple programs; develop computational thinking strategies to solve problems; understand how digital systems work and their impact on society (NZC Digital Technologies, Progress Outcome 3/4; Te Mataiaho: Te Ao Hangarau - Digital Technologies, Te Ao Tangata - Social Sciences).

**KEY COMPETENCIES:** Thinking (designing algorithms, problem-solving, abstracting), Managing Self (perseverance, self-regulation in debugging), Participating and Contributing (collaborative coding, peer support), Using Language, Symbols, and Texts (interpreting code, writing clear instructions).

**VALUES:** Whanaungatanga (collaborative learning, peer support in coding challenges), Manaakitanga (creating an inclusive learning environment where all students feel capable of coding), Whaiora (fostering enjoyment and curiosity in digital creation), T큰rangawaewae (connecting coding to local contexts and student experiences).

**DURATION:** 75 minutes fixed.

**CULTURAL CONSIDERATIONS & ADAPTATIONS:** Use analogies from M훮ori or Pasifika weaving, carving, or storytelling to explain sequential instructions or patterns in code; encourage students to create programs that reflect their cultural identity or solve problems relevant to their communities (e.g., a program to greet in Te Reo M훮ori, calculate costs for a family event); ensure diverse representation in examples and role models.

## Core Lesson Components

**DO NOW ACTIVITY:** Display a simple set of instructions (e.g., how to make a cup of tea, how to perform a basic haka step) and ask students to identify the individual steps and their order, leading into the idea of precise instructions for computers. (10 minutes)

**LEARNING INTENTION:** To understand what programming is and why Python is a good language for beginners, and to write and run simple Python programs.

**SUCCESS CRITERIA:** I can write and execute a basic Python `print()` statement, define and use variables, and perform simple arithmetic operations in Python.

**EXIT TICKET:** Students write one line of Python code that either prints a message, defines a variable, or performs a simple calculation, and explain what it does. (5 minutes)

## Instructions to Teach

Engage students in an interactive exploration of Python's foundational concepts by guiding them through hands-on coding exercises, fostering a collaborative debugging environment, and connecting abstract programming principles to tangible, culturally relevant applications.

## Lesson Content

### What is Python?

Python is a high-level, interpreted programming language known for its simple syntax and readability. It was created by Guido van Rossum and first released in 1991. Think of it as a language that computers understand, but it's designed to be very easy for humans to read and write, almost like plain English.

### Why Learn Python?

*   **Easy to Learn:** Python's syntax is clear and concise, making it an excellent language for beginners. It focuses on simplicity, so you can spend more time learning *what* to code and less time worrying about complex rules.
*   **Versatile:** Python is used in a wide range of applications, from building websites and analyzing massive datasets to creating artificial intelligence and even controlling robots. This means the skills you learn can open many doors!
*   **Large Community:** Python has a large and active community of developers worldwide. This means there are countless online resources, tutorials, and people ready to help if you get stuck or want to learn more.
*   **Real-world Impact:** Python is used by companies like Google, Netflix, and NASA. Learning Python means you're learning a skill used to build some of the most exciting technologies in the world.

### Your First Python Program: "Hello, World!"

The traditional first program in any language is "Hello, World!". It's a simple way to make sure your setup is working and to see immediate results.

To run this program, you will need to have Python installed on your computer, or use an online coding environment (like Replit or Google Colab, which are great for beginners as they require no installation).

```python
print("Kia ora, Ao!") # "Hello, World!" in Te Reo M훮ori
```

This `print()` function tells the computer to display whatever is inside the parentheses `()` on the screen. The text inside the quotes `""` is called a 'string'.

### Variables: Storing Information

In programming, a **variable** is like a container or a box where you can store pieces of information. You give the box a name, and then you can put different things inside it or take them out later.

```python
# Storing a name (text/string)
student_name = "Aroha"
print(student_name)

# Storing a number (integer)
age = 13
print(age)

# You can change what's in the box
student_name = "Wiremu"
print(student_name)
```

### Basic Arithmetic Operations

Python can also act like a powerful calculator. You can perform basic math operations directly or with variables.

*   **Addition:** `+`
*   **Subtraction:** `-`
*   **Multiplication:** `*`
*   **Division:** `/`

```python
# Direct calculations
print(10 + 5)   # Addition
print(20 - 7)   # Subtraction
print(4 * 6)    # Multiplication
print(10 / 2)   # Division

# Calculations with variables
apples = 15
eaten = 7
remaining_apples = apples - eaten
print(remaining_apples)

price_per_item = 2.50
quantity = 4
total_cost = price_per_item * quantity
print(total_cost)
```

### Next Steps

Now that you've learned the basics, you can start experimenting! Try writing your own programs to:

*   Print a message about your favourite place in Aotearoa.
*   Store your age and your friend's age in variables, then calculate the difference.
*   Calculate the total cost of items for a school fundraiser.
