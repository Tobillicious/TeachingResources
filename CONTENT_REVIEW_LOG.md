# Content Enrichment Review Log

This document tracks the comprehensive review of all educational content by the Learning Facilitator and Kaiako teams. The goal is to ensure every resource meets our high standards for pedagogical excellence, cultural responsiveness, and curriculum integration.

## Review Process
1.  **Assign**: An LF or Kaiako is assigned a file to review.
2.  **Review**: The reviewer analyzes the file against the criteria below.
3.  **Log**: The reviewer adds their notes to the log, suggesting specific, actionable enrichments.
4.  **Action**: The `Content_Creator` or `Web_Developer` implements the changes.
5.  **Final Review**: The original reviewer signs off on the changes.

## Review Criteria
-   **Curriculum Alignment**: Are NZC links clear and robust?
-   **Cultural Responsiveness**: Is Te Ao Māori integrated authentically? Is it free of bias? (Consult `Postcolonial_Pedagogical_Reviewer`)
-   **Differentiation**: Are there clear support and extension pathways?
-   **Engagement**: Is the content engaging and relevant to our ākonga?
-   **Linkage**: Can this resource be linked to other handouts, lessons, or units?
-   **"Do Now" Potential**: Can this be adapted into a "Do Now" activity?
